    ['00:07', `Hey everyone!`],
    ['00:07', `Welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:08', `It's Aileen.`],
    ['00:09', `Today I want to share a few new year's resolution ideas to grow your confidence in 2019.`],
    ['00:15', `This is in collaboration with MuchelleB.`],
    ['00:17', `She's another amazing YouTuber.`],
    ['00:19', `Hopefully you know who she is.`],
    ['00:20', `She also makes videos on lifestyle design, simplifying your life, productivity, you name it.`],
    ['00:25', `Together, we're going to share 10 tips on ways to grow your confidence next year.`],
    ['00:30', `I'm going to share five, she's going to share five.`],
    ['00:32', `Make sure you check out her video which is linked down below.`],
    ['00:35', `So let's get started.`],
    ['00:36', `The first way to grow your confidence in 2019 is to start keeping a tab of your small wins.`],
    ['00:44', `There's a reason why I put this section called "Today's Wins" in my Daily Planner that I created,`],
    ['00:49', `because it's so important to count all your little wins,`],
    ['00:52', `because the more wins you have, the more confidence you build in that area.`],
    ['00:57', `I have a whole video that goes into detail on`],
    ['00:59', `how to build your confidence with those small wins, which I'll link down below.`],
    ['01:03', `The basic idea is that, whenever you're starting out something new,`],
    ['01:07', `you're not very confident, you're not very good, and you're very unsure of yourself.`],
    ['01:11', `That's normal and natural.`],
    ['01:13', `You only grow confident by continuing to do that thing, get practice,`],
    ['01:17', `and with practice and action, you get better.`],
    ['01:20', `And as you get better, you'll get positive feedback,`],
    ['01:23', `whether other people tell you you're getting better`],
    ['01:24', `or you're actually seeing the stats of you getting better.`],
    ['01:28', `And those small wins give you a little boost of confidence each time.`],
    ['01:31', `So as you keep trying and developing yourself,`],
    ['01:33', `there will be times where you succeed and you get an easy positive feedback loop.`],
    ['01:37', `There will be times where you fail, where you will feel bad about yourself.`],
    ['01:40', `The thing is, you want to turn everything into a win and a positive feedback loop.`],
    ['01:44', `When you fail, you have to see it in a positive light:`],
    ['01:47', `What did I learn from this situation?`],
    ['01:49', `How can I be better next time?`],
    ['01:51', `So a failure can also be a positive feedback loop.`],
    ['01:54', `A failure is also considered a small win, if you look at it from that way.`],
    ['01:58', `Anyway, keeping a tab of your small wins – your failures and lessons included –`],
    ['02:03', `will give you more confidence to keep going in that area`],
    ['02:06', `because you've seen how far you've already come,`],
    ['02:09', `how much you've already accomplished, and the progress you've already made.`],
    ['02:13', `The next way you can grow your confidence in 2019 is to`],
    ['02:15', `start using empowering affirmations to build your self love.`],
    ['02:19', `We all tend to have negative self talk.`],
    ['02:22', `We're critical on ourselves.`],
    ['02:23', `What you want to do is be able to flip it as soon as you have that negative thought.`],
    ['02:28', `Once you have that negative thought, you want to be able to be aware of it`],
    ['02:31', `and be like, "Hey, I change my mind.`],
    ['02:33', `I choose not to think about that."`],
    ['02:35', `One way to help you build that is to build that positive and empowering vocabulary of self talk.`],
    ['02:40', `So ways you can practice this is to write down the compliments that you want to hear,`],
    ['02:46', `the things that you like to hear from other people that make you feel the best.`],
    ['02:49', `Maybe you like to be complimented on your creativity or how kind you are.`],
    ['02:53', `Write down all of those positive things about yourself.`],
    ['02:56', `Keep it on your phone.`],
    ['02:57', `If you're a visual person, what you can do is create this self love board of yourself.`],
    ['03:02', `Put your picture in the center.`],
    ['03:03', `This could be on paper or digital.`],
    ['03:06', `Around your photo, write down all the positive and empowering affirmations`],
    ['03:11', `that you'd like to hear about yourself.`],
    ['03:14', `Write it on this paper and look at it every day.`],
    ['03:17', `It'll make you feel like you are the center of all this positivity, and it just helps a little bit.`],
    ['03:23', `If you're more of an audible person, maybe you prefer to listen rather than to look at things,`],
    ['03:28', `then what you can do is record yourself saying these positive affirmations to yourself`],
    ['03:32', `and play that recording in the morning when you're getting ready, on your drive to work.`],
    ['03:37', `In that way, you are your own motivator, you're your own best friend`],
    ['03:40', `which is how things should be.`],
    ['03:42', `And you're kind of practicing ingraining that positive self talk,`],
    ['03:46', `getting used to hearing positivity rather than negativity.`],
    ['03:50', `The next resolution you can make to build your confidence next year it to`],
    ['03:53', `take time to declutter and revamp your entire wardrobe and style.`],
    ['03:57', `I really believe that you can be confident from the outside-in, as well as the inside-out.`],
    ['04:02', `Before this, we were talking about self talk which is from the inside.`],
    ['04:04', `But you can also look fabulous on the outside and that makes you confident as well.`],
    ['04:10', `Whether you realize it or not, you are constantly changing as a person,`],
    ['04:13', `you're constantly growing.`],
    ['04:15', `And so, the way that you express yourself, the clothes that you wear,`],
    ['04:19', `should be constantly changing and evolving as well.`],
    ['04:22', `I'm not telling you to go out and buy a whole new wardrobe.`],
    ['04:24', `But I'm just telling you to think about that KonMari method.`],
    ['04:28', `Make sure that everything that you own sparks joy and makes you feel amazing in your life.`],
    ['04:34', `Make sure that everything that you wear promotes your self love and confidence,`],
    ['04:38', `instead of owning sweaters that you feel ugly in`],
    ['04:41', `or owning things that don't fit you quite right anymore.`],
    ['04:44', `Take that time to let go of any old baggage, anything that doesn't serve you anymore.`],
    ['04:48', `Just say thank you and then donate it, send it off,`],
    ['04:52', `out of your life so that you can bring some new energy`],
    ['04:54', `and some new looks and style into your life as well.`],
    ['04:57', `It really does do so much for your confidence.`],
    ['04:59', `The next tip to help you build your confidence in 2019 is to learn to protect your energy,`],
    ['05:05', `meaning it's time to create this bubble around yourself`],
    ['05:09', `where you only choose to let in things that support you,`],
    ['05:13', `support your self love, support your confidence and your well-being.`],
    ['05:17', `Ways you can do this is to start to unfollow or unfriend any person or thing`],
    ['05:23', `that does not serve you, that makes you feel bad about yourself.`],
    ['05:27', `I don't know about you but some people, you've just followed on social media for so long`],
    ['05:30', `but you don't realize that every time you see those posts, you start to feel bad about yourself.`],
    ['05:35', `Maybe you originally followed them for health inspiration,`],
    ['05:38', `and then in the end, they made you feel guilty every time you saw their photos.`],
    ['05:41', `So in that case, just unfollow them.`],
    ['05:43', `It's just healthier for you to not have that negative energy in your feed.`],
    ['05:48', `Same thing with people in your life.`],
    ['05:50', `If anyone's really draining your energy,`],
    ['05:52', `if someone is taking more than giving or more than being a good friend,`],
    ['05:57', `it's time to distance yourself and protect yourself from that negative energy.`],
    ['06:02', `Your priority is your own well-being, so anything that is pulling you down,`],
    ['06:06', `making you feel bad about yourself, making you feel lesser than or unworthy,`],
    ['06:11', `you need to learn to cut it out.`],
    ['06:13', `There's no time for comparing yourself to others, feeling lesser than, feeling unworthy.`],
    ['06:18', `That it just such a waste of your light and your purpose here on this earth.`],
    ['06:23', `Something I heart from Nabela Noor who's another creator that I love,`],
    ['06:26', `she said: "Hating yourself is not doing the world any good."`],
    ['06:30', `And it's so true.`],
    ['06:31', `So anything that makes you feel bad about yourself or hate yourself is just a waste of time.`],
    ['06:36', `You want to cut it out, protect your energy,`],
    ['06:38', `because in 2019, we only have time to be our best selves,`],
    ['06:42', `be uplifted, glowing, fabulous, confident, amazing, all of that.`],
    ['06:46', `The last tip I want to share is for building confidence in social situations in 2019.`],
    ['06:51', `I know a lot of us have social anxiety or we're shy.`],
    ['06:54', `It's awkward to go out, meet people, network. I get it.`],
    ['06:58', `What you want to do is be prepared.`],
    ['07:00', `Prepare an elevator pitch about yourself that, when people ask,`],
    ['07:03', `"Who are you? What do you do?" –`],
    ['07:05', `something that's 1-2 minutes sharing who you are,`],
    ['07:07', `what you do, what you care about, just so you have something to say`],
    ['07:11', `when people introduce themselves to you, asking you about what you do.`],
    ['07:14', `I think the hardest, awkward part about meeting new people is just the beginning,`],
    ['07:18', `of not knowing what to say or how to act.`],
    ['07:21', `So it's best to at least come prepared, and when you come prepared,`],
    ['07:25', `you'll sound a lot more confident in the beginning.`],
    ['07:27', `It's kind of like "fake it til you make it".`],
    ['07:29', `You sound confident and you're going to keep flowing with that confidence from there.`],
    ['07:33', `Another tip for feeling less awkward or uncomfortable on social situations is to`],
    ['07:37', `stop putting the focus on yourself, and instead put your focus and curiosity in other people.`],
    ['07:43', `Just be a curious person.`],
    ['07:45', `Just ask questions.`],
    ['07:47', `Just ask them: "Tell me more about __,"`],
    ['07:50', `and then you'll do more of the talking and you'll do more of the listening.`],
    ['07:53', `I think if you just come prepared about what you want to say about yourself,`],
    ['07:56', `you'll feel confident in that area.`],
    ['07:58', `And then for the rest of the time, put your energy and focus`],
    ['08:01', `into being interested and curious about other people,`],
    ['08:05', `then you're going to feel a lot more confident in a social situation,`],
    ['08:08', `rather than being all self conscious and embarrassed or awkward.`],
    ['08:12', `Alright, so those are five ways to build more confidence in 2019.`],
    ['08:16', `If you want more ways to build confidence,`],
    ['08:17', `check out MuchelleB's video which I'll link down below.`],
    ['08:20', `She's such a gem.`],
    ['08:21', `I'll see you guys in the next one.`],
    ['08:23', `Love you so much.`],
    ['08:24', `Bye!`]
