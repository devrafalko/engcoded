    ['00:00', `This episode of Real Engineering is brought to you by Skillshare, home to over 16,000`],
    ['00:05', `classes that could teach you a new life skill.`],
    ['00:07', `By the time we reach our 80s, our hearts have beat over 3.3 billion times and and have pumped`],
    ['00:12', `250 million litres of blood around the body, enough blood to fill 100 olympic sized pools.`],
    ['00:19', `Just 3 weeks after conception the first muscle cells of the heart begin to contract and don’t`],
    ['00:24', `stop until the moment we die.`],
    ['00:26', `It is quite frankly a marvel that our hearts can last so long.`],
    ['00:29', `Pick up a stress ball and see how many times you can squeeze it before arm starts to cramp`],
    ['00:33', `and tire.`],
    ['00:34', `Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle has much higher numbers of mitochondria, which`],
    ['00:38', `provide the vital energy needed for contractions, and a rich supply of oxygenated blood, it`],
    ['00:42', `never has to worry about the build of lactic acid from working when deprived of oxygen.`],
    ['00:47', `But just because they do not fatigue does not mean they are invincible.`],
    ['00:50', `Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world, as we grow older some`],
    ['00:54', `parts of the heart can deteriorate and cause some problems, but we have developed some`],
    ['00:58', `incredible technology that has extended our lives.`],
    ['01:01', `One of the most common implants in the world being pacemakers, small implantable devices`],
    ['01:05', `that help keep our hearts beating when our natural systems need some help.`],
    ['01:09', `Before seeing how they are implanted and how they work, let’s first see how our own bodies`],
    ['01:13', `have been engineered by nature to keep our blood flowing.`],
    ['01:16', `The heart has two sides separated by an inner wall called the septum.`],
    ['01:20', `The right side of the heart, which on this diagram is on the left, pumps blood to the`],
    ['01:23', `lungs where it is oxygenated and then travels back to the heart where it is pumped by the`],
    ['01:27', `left side to the rest of the body.`],
    ['01:29', `The walls of the left side are much thicker and stronger because of it has to pump blood`],
    ['01:33', `around the entire body, whereas the right side just has to pump it to the lungs and`],
    ['01:37', `back.`],
    ['01:38', `The heart consists of 4 chambers the left and right ventricles and the left and right`],
    ['01:42', `atria, the atria and ventricles are separated by valves.`],
    ['01:45', `At the start of the heart beat all 4 chambers are relaxed and the valves are open.`],
    ['01:50', `Blood flows into the heart from large veins and the heart reaches max capacity.`],
    ['01:54', `Just here there are a bundle of cells called the Sinoatrial node that are capable of producing`],
    ['01:59', `a electric impulse that will travel through the heart and cause it to contract in a specific`],
    ['02:03', `order.`],
    ['02:04', `First the impulse travel to the AV node located here, where it triggers both atria to contract,`],
    ['02:10', `squeezing blood out of the atria into the left and right ventricles.`],
    ['02:13', `The electric impulse has now travelled down through the heart to fibres located in the`],
    ['02:17', `ventricle walls that now cause them to contract, as the pressure rises it forces these valves`],
    ['02:22', `to shut and prevents blood from flowing backwards.`],
    ['02:25', `You can see each of these stages on the classic electrocardiogram.`],
    ['02:29', `The first little bump is the atria contracting, followed by the spike of the stronger ventricles`],
    ['02:34', `contracting and finally there is another little bump as ventricles recover.`],
    ['02:38', `For most, this sequence of events goes unnoticed thousands of times a day.`],
    ['02:42', `But some may need a little help controlling their heart beat.`],
    ['02:45', `sometimes the Sinoatrial node’s ability to set the correct pace breaks down, leading`],
    ['02:49', `to slower heartbeats or long pauses between heartbeats.`],
    ['02:52', `There are a range of reasons why you may need help and this is why the incredible pacemaker`],
    ['02:57', `was invented.`],
    ['02:58', `And as with most medical inventions it started as an incredibly dangerous and scary device.`],
    ['03:03', `The first being invented by Albert S Hyman in the 1930s.`],
    ['03:07', `It consisted of a hand cranked spring motor, which would store the hand crank rotation`],
    ['03:11', `as potential energy in a spring.`],
    ['03:13', `This spring motor then drove a generator, with these large U-Shaped magnets providing`],
    ['03:17', `the magnetic flux needed to generate a direct current voltage.`],
    ['03:21', `The current was then pulsed by a rotating interrupter disk with four conducting pads`],
    ['03:25', `which intermittently made contact with a brush which supplied this huge needle electrode.`],
    ['03:30', `Amazingly this little machine was portable, but it proved ineffective due to the low voltage`],
    ['03:34', `output.`],
    ['03:35', `His work was ultimately abandoned, but other researchers recognised its potential after`],
    ['03:40', `the second world war.`],
    ['03:41', `A method of inducing hypothermia by cooling the heart until it stopped beating to allow`],
    ['03:46', `it to be worked on during surgery was being investigated, but upon rewarming it was found`],
    ['03:50', `that the heart needed help with controlling heart rate as metabolic function recovered.`],
    ['03:55', `And John A. Hopps developed this device for the job, delivering impulses at the desired`],
    ['03:59', `rate through paddles that were placed inside the chest cavity during surgery near the Sinoatrial`],
    ['04:05', `Node.`],
    ['04:06', `The potential of using such a device on patients suffering from heart defects at normal temperatures`],
    ['04:10', `was soon realised, but repeated applications of high voltages cause muscle pain and twitches,`],
    ['04:15', `along with burns.`],
    ['04:16', `Making it unsuitable for extended use.`],
    ['04:18', `What we needed was an implantable device.`],
    ['04:21', `Hopps developed a catheter electrode, which removed the need for open chest surgeries`],
    ['04:25', `by passing the electrodes through the subclavian vein and into the heart.`],
    ['04:29', `On halloween night 1957 a power outage struck a minneapolis hospital, leaving several young`],
    ['04:35', `patients without pacing from the mains powered pacemakers, killing one of the children and`],
    ['04:40', `pushing famed heart surgeon Dr. C Walton Lillehei to request the hospitals technician Earl Bakken`],
    ['04:46', `to develop a battery powered pacemaker.`],
    ['04:48', `He returned with this device, a wearable pacemaker powered by mercury batteries that would launch`],
    ['04:53', `Earl Bakken’s company Medtronic into the fortune 500.`],
    ['04:57', `This was a revolutionary device, but the need to pass the wires through the skin was a constant`],
    ['05:01', `infection risk.`],
    ['05:03', `What was needed was a fully implantable device and with continual improvements to transistors`],
    ['05:07', `allowing for the miniaturization of circuitry, and improvements to batteries this was soon`],
    ['05:12', `realised.`],
    ['05:13', `This was the first ever fully implantable pacemaker, created and implanted in Sweden`],
    ['05:18', `to save Arne Larsson’s life.`],
    ['05:21', `With a rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery, which was charged through this induction coil`],
    ['05:25', `overnight about once a month.`],
    ['05:26', `It utilized some of the first silicon transistors imported into Sweden, allowing it to use less`],
    ['05:32', `energy over older Germanium transistors.`],
    ['05:35', `All this was encapsulated in a biocompatible epoxy resin.`],
    ['05:38', `Arne Larsson survived to 86, with his pacemaker being replaced a total of 25 times over the`],
    ['05:43', `course of his life, as the technology improved incrementally.`],
    ['05:47', `[5] Current generation pacemakers are now smaller`],
    ['05:49', `and more reliable than ever.`],
    ['05:52', `Medtronic have even developed the world’s smallest pacemaker which is implanted directly`],
    ['05:56', `into the right ventricle without any cables, and eliminating the need for the pacemaker`],
    ['06:00', `to be implanted under the skin, which can lead to discomfort.`],
    ['06:03', `Over 700,000 pacemakers are implanted worldwide every year.`],
    ['06:08', `[2] These devices help people live healthier, happier lives and have advanced so far that`],
    ['06:12', `many can practically forget that they suffer from heart disease.`],
    ['06:15', `This subject is something I spent 4 years studying to work with, and have worked in`],
    ['06:19', `the medical device industry in the past with Medtronic.`],
    ['06:21', `I am however completely self taught in illustration and animation.`],
    ['06:25', `I designed this logo over 3 years, and today I am happy to unveil the new updated version`],
    ['06:30', `which someone who actually knows what they are doing designed.`],
    ['06:33', `I essentially just traced a gear tooth and attempted to make it look like the font I`],
    ['06:37', `was using, with no real design experience.`],
    ['06:40', `I may have fared better with making look professional if I watch some of these skillshare classes`],
    ['06:44', `on logo design first.`],
    ['06:46', `They teach simple things about shape, type and colour, which I just had no idea about`],
    ['06:50', `at the time.`],
    ['06:52', `Something as simple as fixing the symmetry of height and width of my logo has done wonders,`],
    ['06:56', `and that’s the type of thing this course will teach you.`],
    ['06:59', `These days you can teach yourself pretty much any skill online and Skillshare is a fantastic`],
    ['07:03', `place to do it.`],
    ['07:04', `With professional and understandable classes, that follow a clear learning curve, you can`],
