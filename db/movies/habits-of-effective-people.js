    ['00:00', `In a lot of ways, busyness has become glorified in our society.`],
    ['00:03', `You see someone else who's working really hard,`],
    ['00:05', `and you feel like it's a bit of a competition.`],
    ['00:07', `If you're not being as busy as they are, maybe you're just being lazy.`],
    ['00:11', `But you see being busy doesn't necessarily mean you're being more effective with your time.`],
    ['00:18', `A busy person might take an hour to get a task done that an effective person could get done in about 15 minutes.`],
    ['00:24', `So let me ask you: would you rather be a busy person or an effective person?`],
    ['00:28', `I'm hoping you're gonna say the latter, because in today's video we're gonna explore some characteristics of effective people.`],
    ['00:37', `Effective people focus their time and energy on things that they can control,`],
    ['00:41', `like scheduling their time or focusing on healthy habits.`],
    ['00:45', `The one thing you won't see them doing is complaining about things that are out of their control.`],
    ['00:49', `Because really, what good does it do to complain about the weather?`],
    ['00:52', `You see three things that crush all productivity and effectiveness are comparing,`],
    ['00:57', `criticizing and complaining.`],
    ['00:59', `And remember one thing that you do have control over is your mindset.`],
    ['01:03', `So let's say for example that you're comparing yourself to someone else.`],
    ['01:07', `Maybe you envy their work or their healthy lifestyle choices often comparing them leads to self-criticism,`],
    ['01:13', `and then we go on to complain about it to our friends or to our family.`],
    ['01:17', `So you can see how it becomes a bit of a vicious loop of things we let our mind focus on.`],
    ['01:22', `Precious mental energy that could instead be used to work on something constructive.`],
    ['01:28', `So be proactive, realize that you can take charge,`],
    ['01:31', `and break the chain anytime you feel yourself being emotionally affected by external stimuli.`],
    ['01:39', `In a previous video on productivity,`],
    ['01:41', `I shared with you the Eisenhower decision matrix.`],
    ['01:43', `And I love this thing. It's essentially where you categorize your tasks based on their importance and their urgency.`],
    ['01:50', `More commonly, people spend most of their time putting out fires by focusing on items that are in the high`],
    ['01:56', `urgency and high importance quadrant.`],
    ['01:58', `And that makes sense, but for long-term effectiveness, we want to put as much of our time as we can afford`],
    ['02:02', `into quadrant number two. These are the tasks that are of high importance,`],
    ['02:06', `but low urgency.`],
    ['02:08', `Working in quadrant two means you're going to be working on those things that you really truly value.`],
    ['02:12', `Things that are really important to you, and that offer a sense of fulfillment.`],
    ['02:16', `And when we're able to accomplish the items that are in this quadrant,`],
    ['02:18', `we're gonna feel more motivated to continue working effectively.`],
    ['02:25', `You might have heard that one habit of ultra successful people is that they read`],
    ['02:29', `a lot.`],
    ['02:30', `And the wonderful thing about reading or listening to books`],
    ['02:32', `is that you can chip away at it during your downtime.`],
    ['02:35', `Like when you're in commute,`],
    ['02:36', `or just before bed, or setting it to play`],
    ['02:38', `while you're cleaning or cooking.`],
    ['02:40', `But for those of you who feel you just don't have the time to go through an entire book,`],
    ['02:43', `there's an app I highly recommend called Blinkist.`],
    ['02:46', `And I am forever grateful to my sister for having introduced me to this.`],
    ['02:50', `Essentially what Blinkist does, is they take the insights from thousands of different books,`],
    ['02:54', `and they compress it into 15 minutes that you can either read or listen to on the go.`],
    ['02:58', `Now you can get a free trial to test it out and if you do,`],
    ['03:00', `I highly recommend listening to the 15 minutes of gold from the book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey.`],
    ['03:08', `And actually some of the points I mentioned in this video came from the book.`],
    ['03:11', `Another way that I personally use the app is as a bit of a filter`],
    ['03:15', `after I've listened to 15 minutes of a book and it's key points,`],
    ['03:18', `if I want to learn more`],
    ['03:19', `then I go ahead and invest my time in listening to the book in full.`],
    ['03:23', `So if you're interested in getting a monthly or yearly membership,`],
    ['03:26', `Blinkist has been kind enough to partner with us on this video.`],
    ['03:28', `Which means that you can get 20% off the cost of membership`],
    ['03:31', `to the first 500 people to click the link in the description box below.`],
    ['03:38', `Some people work better in the morning, some after lunch, and others are more efficient in the evenings.`],
    ['03:43', `What you want to do is make sure that you schedule your most important thought and labor-intensive`],
    ['03:48', `tasks during that period of time you know you're gonna be the most productive.`],
    ['03:52', `And then leave the filler more mindless activities`],
    ['03:55', `like responding to emails maybe,`],
    ['03:57', `for when you know your energy tends to be a bit more drained.`],
    ['04:03', `Now that we know when we're the most productive it's time to schedule our day, and if I can recommend`],
    ['04:07', `I would say do it the day before if that's possible.`],
    ['04:10', `That way you're not spending any precious mental energy first thing in the morning,`],
    ['04:13', `trying to figure out what you need to do.`],
    ['04:15', `I'm a morning person, so I try to schedule the more difficult and important tasks first thing.`],
    ['04:20', `I also write down how long I predict it's gonna take me to complete a particular task.`],
    ['04:24', `And by doing this I'm actually practicing envisioning.`],
    ['04:27', `I mean I have to imagine how long I think it's gonna take me to get the task done,`],
    ['04:31', `and by envisioning, we're always more likely to see tasks through.`],
    ['04:35', `Creating schedules also makes us more accountable`],
    ['04:37', `to getting the tasks done in that preset amount of time.`],
    ['04:43', `If a lumberjack complains it takes too much time to sharpen his saw,`],
    ['04:46', `he simply won't be as effective at cutting down trees.`],
    ['04:49', `The same goes for our physical, mental, and spiritual health.`],
    ['04:52', `We need to take the time for breaks and self-care`],
    ['04:55', `or we're not going to be as effective.`],
    ['04:57', `So it's important that when you're scheduling your day,`],
    ['04:59', `you also take the time to schedule your breaks,`],
    ['05:01', `both short and long ones.`],
    ['05:03', `That way you don't feel guilty for taking some much needed time off.`],
    ['05:10', `There's a long-standing debate about whether multitasking allows us to be more effective or less effective.`],
    ['05:15', `And I think a lot of the research is just coming down to it just depends on what area you work in.`],
    ['05:21', `Now I'm somebody who always thought I was an amazing multitasker,`],
    ['05:24', `but recently I started questioning that a bit.`],
    ['05:26', `I mean just because I was a good multitasker didn't mean I was being as effective with my job.`],
    ['05:32', `So I decided I would challenge myself`],
    ['05:34', `by focusing on just doing one thing at a time.`],
    ['05:37', `Working on it completely and seeing it through to the end before picking up another big task.`],
    ['05:41', `I felt that since I've started doing this, I've been much more effective with my time.`],
    ['05:45', `I feel I'm actually accomplishing tasks which is rewarding. Comparing this to multitasking,`],
    ['05:50', `I had the feeling I was being busy and doing a bit of everything,`],
    ['05:53', `but without as frequently finishing any one thing.`],
    ['05:56', `But what do you think? Are you somebody who is a more efficient multitasker?`],
    ['06:00', `Or more of a one-at-a-time kind of person?`],
    ['06:03', `Alright, "Less being busy, more being effective".`],
    ['06:05', `Thumbs up if you agree.`],
    ['06:07', `And that's it for today, folks.`],
    ['06:08', `Thanks a lot for watching.`],
    ['06:09', `Pick Up Limes signing off. We'll see you in the next video.`]
