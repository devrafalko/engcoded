    ['00:00', `The link between language and how we view the world`],
    ['00:02', `is something that has always fascinated me.`],
    ['00:04', `Language isn't just a tremendous form of communication,`],
    ['00:07', `it's also intertwined and influenced by culture and history.`],
    ['00:12', `It saddens me how much high school ruins languages for so many people.`],
    ['00:17', `I hear countless people say "Oh I took French in high school"`],
    ['00:19', `but five years later they're left with practically nothing.`],
    ['00:22', `Something so wonderful is turned into a chore and into something that you have to suffer through.`],
    ['00:28', `The experience of learning and mastering a new language is incomparable. It's truly unlike anything else.`],
    ['00:34', `And more than ever I think we need to be learning other languages to bridge the gaps that exist between us.`],
    ['00:40', `So I thought I would share my experience learning foreign languages`],
    ['00:44', `and the journey that it has taken me on.`],
    ['00:46', `I'm going to start from the beginning here.`],
    ['00:47', `So I technically come from a bilingual household.`],
    ['00:50', `Both of my parents are from Argentina.`],
    ['00:51', `When I tell people this they usually think "oh so you must have been bilingual your entire life."`],
    ['00:56', `and that is very far from the truth. I wish things were that simple.`],
    ['00:59', `It's true that Spanish was my first language and I spoke it until the age of four.`],
    ['01:04', `but both my parents speak excellent English and`],
    ['01:06', `when I started to go to school in the United States where I grew up, and where I was born,`],
    ['01:11', `I quickly lost any ability to speak, or even understand, Spanish.`],
    ['01:15', `English very quickly became the only language that was present in my life.`],
    ['01:19', `When I was 13 my family took a trip to Panama.`],
    ['01:22', `and I remember not being able to understand anything that the locals were saying`],
    ['01:26', `and that became a huge source of frustration and embarrassment.`],
    ['01:30', `I felt limited.`],
    ['01:32', `I can't speak Spanish.`],
    ['01:33', `Not being able to speak the language that the vast majority of my family could speak`],
    ['01:37', `felt like this massive, insurmountable obstacle`],
    ['01:41', `that was blocking me from my own roots`],
    ['01:43', `and from interacting with tons of different people.`],
    ['01:45', `Due to a long series of events and me desperately trying to get out of the US public school system`],
    ['01:52', `I managed to convince a Rotary Club to sponsor me to study for a year in France.`],
    ['01:57', `I was 16 so this was still in high school`],
    ['01:59', `and looking back, this was a very pivotal moment in my life.`],
    ['02:03', `I've mentioned France a couple times in previous videos of mine, but it's difficult for me to describe`],
    ['02:08', `just how formative this year was for me.`],
    ['02:11', `So, August of 2014 I suddenly find myself in a new continent,`],
    ['02:16', `and unable to understand practically anything anyone is saying around me.`],
    ['02:20', `I was starting from scratch. I could only speak English.`],
    ['02:23', `France up to that point was just this far off place that I had only had the most superficial understanding of.`],
    ['02:30', `Just stereotypes really.`],
    ['02:32', `The people don't wash themselves. They eat snails.`],
    ['02:35', `And that they wear stripes.`],
    ['02:36', `If you take a moment to think about it, it's really a limited view of how things really are.`],
    ['02:41', `I knew that to bridge the gap I had to start speaking the language of the people.`],
    ['02:45', `And it was crazy what that was like.`],
    ['02:47', `People literally construct their thoughts differently in other languages`],
    ['02:50', `so in a sense you're learning a new way of thinking.`],
    ['02:53', `I was absorbing every word that I possibly could`],
    ['02:57', `and for the first few months I was there so much slipped through my fingers like water.`],
    ['03:08', `I remember being so tired at the end of every day`],
    ['03:11', `because I was desperately trying to grasp on to what was taking place around me.`],
    ['03:25', `But with time it was like my brain started to connect the dots,`],
    ['03:27', `and little by little I was able to put my thoughts and feelings into words that were new to my lips.`],
    ['04:22', `It gave me a better understanding and appreciation of my upbringing, and where I come from.`],
    ['04:27', `In so many moments during my time in Europe, I was made to reconsider my ideas and opinions.`],
    ['04:34', `It's kinda like when you're looking at a math problem,`],
    ['04:36', `and you say to yourself "Holy cow, there's so much I wasn't considering here"`],
    ['04:41', `I returned to the US after that year abroad and it was immediately apparent to me`],
    ['04:46', `that I was addicted.`],
    ['04:47', `If I could do this once, who's to say it couldn't be done again?`],
    ['04:50', `And that's exactly what I did.`],
    ['04:52', `I saved up my money for a couple of years`],
    ['04:54', `and then I left to live for a few months in Argentina.`],
    ['04:57', `Once again I was in a place that I knew very little about and was really putting myself in foreign circumstances.`],
    ['05:06', `This time it was a little bit different. I was digging into my past. The history of my family.`],
    ['05:12', `I don't want this to sound like it was all perfect and easy.`],
    ['05:15', `It actually ended up becoming a very difficult period in my life`],
    ['05:18', `on an emotional level.`],
    ['05:20', `But what I'm saying here is that yeah, okay maybe it was difficult. But it was absolutely worth it.`],
    ['06:05', `That experience gave me a level of gratitude for what I have that I did not have before.`],
    ['06:09', `I've had amazing work opportunities thanks to the fact that I speak Spanish.`],
    ['06:13', `I mean there are more native Spanish speakers than there are native English speakers.`],
    ['06:17', `Kinda crazy.`],
    ['06:18', `Due to very poor media coverage, I originally had a very two-dimensional perspective on things`],
    ['06:25', `but I walked away from my time there with completely new eyes.`],
    ['06:30', `I think one of the biggest lessons that I learned is that there's`],
    ['06:32', `almost always more than one way to do things. You know?`],
    ['06:35', `To prepare food, to socialize, to structure society.`],
    ['06:39', `What blows my mind is that there's an unlimited amount of opportunities to have this kind of experience.`],
    ['06:45', `Every time you learn a new language you're interfacing with and encountering new things.`],
    ['07:01', `It's not just pizza and pasta. There's a whole universe to explore.`],
    ['07:05', `It's difficult, it's not easy to learn a new language. But it's worth it.`],
    ['07:08', `I think the trick is to have really solid habits in place and also to play to your strengths.`],
    ['07:13', `Go towards the things that interest and excite you.`],
    ['07:16', `I've come to realize that languages exist in many forms.`],
    ['07:19', `Of course there's French, Spanish, and Italian`],
    ['07:22', `but music is also a language.`],
    ['07:24', `Coding is a language.`],
    ['07:25', `Film and photography are visual languages.`],
    ['07:28', `All of these things that were learned and incorporated into your life are enriching`],
    ['07:32', `and expand what is possible in your present reality.`],
    ['07:35', `These languages are just ways to connect dots and to put meaning into your time here on this planet.`],
    ['08:27', `If there's one thing that I hope you walk away with after having watched this video`],
    ['08:31', `it's that, even though throwing yourself into the unknown and learning a new way of seeing the world`],
    ['08:36', `is difficult`],
    ['08:38', `extremely difficult,`],
    ['08:39', `it is worth it.`],
    ['08:41', `So,`],
    ['08:42', `So, Good luck!`]
