    ['00:05', `Go back to school?`],
    ['00:07', `Not work at all? What would you do?`],
    ['00:10', `This concept is called a universal basic income or UBI`],
    ['00:14', `And it's nothing less than the most ambitious social policy of our times`],
    ['00:19', `in 2017, basic income is gaining momentum around the world`],
    ['00:24', `First trials are ongoing or on their way`],
    ['00:27', `and a growing number of countries are considering UBI as an alternative to welfare`],
    ['00:33', `How would it work and what are the key arguments for and against?`],
    ['00:38', `Right now people can't really agree. What universal basic income is or should be`],
    ['00:43', `Some want to use it to eliminate welfare and Cupp bureaucracy`],
    ['00:47', `Others want it as a free extra for existing programs, or even want it to be so high that work itself becomes optional`],
    ['00:55', `For this video we'll talk mostly about the minimum basic income`],
    ['00:59', `enough money to be above the poverty line`],
    ['01:02', `in the US this means about $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year`],
    ['01:07', `The money would not be taxed and you could do whatever you wanted with it in`],
    ['01:12', `In this scenario UBI is a way of transferring the wealth of a society`],
    ['01:17', `while still keeping the free market intact`],
    ['01:20', `But if we hand out free money will people just spend it on booze and stop working?`],
    ['01:27', `A 2013 study by the World Bank`],
    ['01:29', `specifically examined if poor people waste their handouts on tobacco and alcohol if they receive it in the form of cash`],
    ['01:36', `The clear answer, no they don't. The opposite is true`],
    ['01:41', `Other studies have shown that the richer you are, the more drugs and alcohol you consume`],
    ['01:46', `The lazy and drunk poor person is a stereotype rather than reality`],
    ['01:51', `What about laziness?`],
    ['01:54', `Universal basic income test runs done in Canada in the 1970s showed that around`],
    ['01:59', `1% of the recipients stopped working, mostly to take care of their kids`],
    ['02:03', `On average people reduced their working hours by less than 10%`],
    ['02:08', `The extra time was used to achieve goals like going back to school or looking for better jobs`],
    ['02:14', `But if laziness and drugs are not a huge deal, Why doesn't our current welfare state solve poverty`],
    ['02:22', `Welfare or unemployment programs often come with a lot of strings attached`],
    ['02:26', `Like taking part in courses,`],
    ['02:28', `Applying to a certain number of jobs a month or accepting any kind of job offer`],
    ['02:33', `no matter if it's a good fit, or what it pays`],
    ['02:36', `Besides the loss of personal freedom, these conditions are often a huge waste of time and only served to make the unemployment statistics`],
    ['02:43', `Seem less bad`],
    ['02:45', `Often your time would be much better spent looking for the right job`],
    ['02:49', `continuing education or starting a business`],
    ['02:52', `Another unwanted side effect of many welfare programs is that they trap people in poverty and promote passive behavior`],
    ['03:01', `Imagine a benefit of $1,000 each month`],
    ['03:03', `in a lot of programs if you earn a single dollar extra the whole thing is taken away`],
    ['03:09', `If you take a job, that's paying $1200 you might not only lose your benefits,`],
    ['03:14', `but because of your taxes and another costs like transportation`],
    ['03:17', `You might end up having less money than before`],
    ['03:20', `So if you actively try to better your situation, and your total income is not improving or even a shrinking`],
    ['03:27', `welfare can create a ceiling that traps people in poverty`],
    ['03:31', `and rewards passive behavior`],
    ['03:33', `A basic income can never be cut and therefore getting a job and additional income would always make your financial situation better`],
    ['03:42', `Work is always rewarded`],
    ['03:44', `instead of a ceiling it creates a floor from which people can lift themselves up`],
    ['03:50', `But even if UBI is the better model, is it economically feasible?`],
    ['03:55', `What about inflation?`],
    ['03:56', `Won't prices just rise making everything just like it was before?`],
    ['04:01', `Since the money is not being created by magic or printers it needs to be transferred from somewhere`],
    ['04:07', `It's more of a shift of funds than the creation of new ones`],
    ['04:11', `Hence; no inflation`],
    ['04:14', `Ok, but how do we pay for it?`],
    ['04:16', `There's no right answer here because the world is too diverse`],
    ['04:20', `How well-off the country is, what the local values are,`],
    ['04:24', `Are things like high taxes or cutting the defence budget politically acceptable or not?`],
    ['04:30', `How much welfare state is already in place and is it effective?`],
    ['04:35', `Each country has its own individual path to a UBI`],
    ['04:39', `The easiest way to pay for a UBI is to end all welfare and use the free funds to finance it`],
    ['04:46', `Not only would this make a number of government agencies disappear, which in itself saves money, it would also eliminate a lot of bureaucracy`],
    ['04:54', `on the other hand cutting them could leave many people worse off than before`],
    ['04:59', `If the goal is to have a foundation for everybody there still need to be programs of some sort because just like countries,`],
    ['05:06', `People are not the same`],
    ['05:08', `The second way - higher taxes especially for the very wealthy`],
    ['05:13', `In the US for example there's been a lot of economic growth but most of the benefits from it have gone to the richest few percent`],
    ['05:20', `the wealth gap is rapidly widening`],
    ['05:23', `and many argue that it might be time to distribute the spoils more evenly to preserve the social peace`],
    ['05:30', `There could be taxes on financial transactions, capital, land value, carbon, or even robots`],
    ['05:37', `But UBI is not necessarily expensive`],
    ['05:40', `According to a recent study`],
    ['05:43', `a UBI of $1,000 per month in the US`],
    ['05:45', `Could actually grow the GDP by 12% over eight years`],
    ['05:50', `because it would enable poor people to spend more and increase overall demand`],
    ['05:56', `What about the people who do the dirty work?`],
    ['05:58', `Who will work in the fields, crawl through sewers, or lift pianos?`],
    ['06:03', `If you don't need to for survival, will people still do hard boring and unfulfilling labor?`],
    ['06:10', `UBI might give them enough leverage to demand better pay and working conditions`],
    ['06:15', `a study calculated that every extra dollar going to wage earners would add about $1.21 to the national economy`],
    ['06:22', `While every extra dollar going to high-income Americans would add only 39 cents`],
    ['06:27', `There would still be very rich and poor people`],
    ['06:30', `but we could eliminate fear, suffering, and existential panic for a significant part of the population`],
    ['06:37', `Making poor citizens better off could be a smart economic tactic`],
    ['06:43', `For some this isn't enough. They want a UBI large enough to live a middle-class existence`],
    ['06:49', `If we set the financial obstacle aside, this idea fundamentally challenges, how our society is constructed`],
    ['06:57', `By earning money, you earn the possibility to take part in society this determines your status and options`],
    ['07:04', `But it also forces many people into spending huge chunks of their time on things they don't care about`],
    ['07:11', `in 2016 only 33% of US employees were engaged at work`],
    ['07:16', `16% were actively miserable and the remaining 51% were only physically present`],
    ['07:23', `Would 67% of people stop working if they could?`],
    ['07:27', `It would be unfair to portray work as just a chore`],
    ['07:31', `work gives us something to do. It challenges us`],
    ['07:35', `it motivates us to improve, it forces us to engage`],
    ['07:38', `Many find friends or partners at work, we work for social status wealth and our place in the world`],
    ['07:45', `We're looking for something to do with our lives and for many people work gives them meaning`],
    ['07:52', `There are other concerns with UBI`],
    ['07:54', `If all welfare programs were exchanged for one single payment, this gives the government a lot of leverage`],
    ['08:01', `individual programs are easier to attack or cut than a multitude`],
    ['08:07', `or populist smite promise drastic changes to the UBI to get into power`],
    ['08:12', `and a universal basic income doesn't tackle all problems when it comes to equality`],
    ['08:18', `Rents for example`],
    ['08:19', `while $1,000 might be great in the countryside, it's not a lot for expensive metropolitan areas`],
    ['08:25', `which could lead to poor people moving outwards and the difference between rich and poor`],
    ['08:30', `becoming even more extreme`],
    ['08:32', `and of course, for some people, the concept of work itself not being essential for survival is appalling`],
    ['08:39', `Conclusion`],
    ['08:42', `So is the universal basic income a good idea? The honest answer is that we don't know yet`],
    ['08:49', `There needs to be a lot more research more and bigger test runs`],
    ['08:53', `We need to think about what kind of UBI we want and what we're prepared to give up to pay for it`],
    ['08:59', `The potential is huge. It might be the most promising model to sustainably eliminate poverty`],
    ['09:06', `It might seriously reduce the amount of desperation in the world and make us all much less stressed out`],
    ['09:16', `This video was made possible by a`],
    ['09:18', `Universal basic income provided by you, our viewers`],
    ['09:22', `Ten thousand people around the world gift us a monthly income on patreon.com/Kurzgesagt`],
    ['09:29', `You enable us to pay salaries and buy new hardware you enable us to make more videos`],
    ['09:34', `And you enable us to spend more time on them`],
    ['09:37', `Kurzgesagt would truly not be what it is today without your help`],
    ['09:41', `You help us stay independent, and you give us the freedom to put quality before quantity`],
    ['09:47', `Thank you so much`]
