    ['01:47', `you in one of the earlier episodes but`],
    ['01:49', `we just touched on very slightly like`],
    ['01:53', `why why create this like wait why quite`],

    ['02:06', `just yeah I'm gonna spend like a ton all`],
    ['02:09', `my savings`],
    ['02:10', `yes sitting around coding on this`],
    ['02:13', `project`],
    ['02:13', `yeah yeah why that's a good question`],
    ['02:15', `yeah it's not sort of like this is not`],
    ['02:17', `gonna be like this gonna be very hard to`],
    ['02:19', `flip ya there's no monetary upside to`],
    ['02:23', `this I think ya know it's purely a`],
    ['02:26', `passion products I think maybe if if`],
    ['02:29', `people didn't watch the previous`],
    ['02:30', `episodes I could quickly mention that`],
    ['02:32', `what we're talking about is basically`],
    ['02:34', `like somewhere between a game and a`],
    ['02:37', `research platform for evolution within a`],
    ['02:41', `computer where you pray to the creatures`],
    ['02:43', `and you like let them out into a world`],
    ['02:44', `and yeah basically exploration in`],
    ['02:48', `machine learning in in evolution and in`],
    ['02:52', `WebGL and typescripts yeah it's all they`],
    ['02:56', `said I mean so of course part of this is`],
    ['02:58', `like the fascination of Technology and`],
    ['03:00', `just I really love programming and just`],
    ['03:03', `you know getting into that this`],
    ['03:06', `particular projects I mean I've done`],
    ['03:07', `many projects as you know before and`],
    ['03:09', `they go from everything from like games`],
    ['03:13', `into a gate toll and to like a bunch of`],
    ['03:17', `different things for this particular one`],
    ['03:20', `it was just a fascination with a`],
    ['03:23', `specific traffic topic which was`],
    ['03:24', `evolution and it started out as a`],
    ['03:27', `conversation with a friend many years`],
    ['03:29', `ago where we just talked about evolution`],
    ['03:31', `for for for a whole summer we're just`],
    ['03:33', `talking about evolution because we were`],
    ['03:35', `so fascinated and then we started`],
    ['03:36', `thinking what did you both read the same`],
    ['03:40', `thing like nothing he's from Texas and`],
    ['03:45', `he was telling me that like they didn't`],
    ['03:47', `explain it too well in his school it was`],
    ['03:51', `very like you know brushed over and then`],
    ['03:53', `when it was kinda like we don't want to`],
    ['03:57', `touch this because god I don't know we`],
    ['04:00', `didn't actually go too deep into that`],
    ['04:02', `but he didn't he got curious about`],
    ['04:04', `evolution as an adult and then he wanted`],
    ['04:07', `to read about it and I'm from Sweden and`],
    ['04:10', `in Sweden they like they did talk more`],
    ['04:13', `about evolution school but as he was`],
    ['04:15', `talking about evolution I realized that`],
    ['04:16', `I didn't know anything about evolution`],
    ['04:18', `as well so is this super interesting`],
    ['04:21', `topic to get into so this kind of led us`],
    ['04:25', `into exploring evolution and I just got`],
    ['04:29', `curious and then you know with this`],
    ['04:31', `project we started that like I got`],
    ['04:33', `curious curious again for different`],
    ['04:34', `reasons and then just kept you know`],
    ['04:38', `being here is he's discovering like`],
    ['04:41', `every day finding something new that was`],
    ['04:43', `like oh I didn't expect that and you`],
    ['04:45', `know just purely out of a sense of`],
    ['04:48', `exploration cannot I go into some new`],
    ['04:51', `country or some weird place that you've`],
    ['04:54', `never visited before and every step you`],
    ['04:57', `take you kind of go like oh what's over`],
    ['04:59', `here like that's odd`],
    ['05:00', `yeah what's like I really like the sense`],
    ['05:03', `of like a world opening up itself when`],
    ['05:07', `you start learning a new field yes like`],
    ['05:11', `it was when I started when I started`],
    ['05:13', `getting into youtubing it was like this`],
    ['05:16', `enormous lee productive feeling of like`],
    ['05:20', `oh my god I can like like learn this`],
    ['05:22', `like I learned this like oh this is how`],
    ['05:24', `it works and learning about video`],
    ['05:27', `production again and like figuring out`],
    ['05:29', `like oh this is the microphones that`],
    ['05:31', `people are you saying and like there's`],
    ['05:32', `so much you're moving so fast and you're`],
    ['05:36', `learning what you enter a new field`],
    ['05:38', `instead of like when I'm in web`],
    ['05:39', `development I kind of like okay there's`],
    ['05:42', `you it's a little bit like Redux`],
    ['05:45', `but it's different a little bit like it`],
    ['05:48', `is like all that like this incremental`],
    ['05:50', `learning it's like you know explosions`],
    ['05:52', `and yeah I mean it fits into the pattern`],
    ['05:55', `when you go from react to vivo or ever`],
    ['05:58', `that's pronounced yeah when you do that`],
    ['06:00', `step it kind of fits into the pattern of`],
    ['06:02', `things you learned but when you go do it`],
    ['06:04', `completing you feel it's like this sense`],
    ['06:06', `of exploration and yeah you just feel`],
    ['06:09', `your brain going into like this`],
    ['06:11', `plasticity that didn't need to be right`],
    ['06:14', `and I I mean I have to say that Allah`],
    ['06:16', `the crossover between you know something`],
    ['06:20', `that you know and something that you`],
    ['06:21', `don't know I mean in this case it's`],
    ['06:23', `programming with`],
    ['06:24', `evolution and that's just fascinating`],
    ['06:27', `because there's an interplay between`],
    ['06:28', `these things that is a little bit`],
    ['06:30', `unexplored and there are many things`],
    ['06:32', `like that where you take one thing and`],
    ['06:34', `then you combine it with something else`],
    ['06:35', `and maybe no one has ever looked at`],
    ['06:38', `those two things in combination and you`],
    ['06:40', `might learn ton and you know you really`],
    ['06:43', `do something that no one has been doing`],
    ['06:45', `before yeah it's I really like this is`],
    ['06:49', `pick sling as a project is surprising`],
    ['06:53', `like it's I'm not sure if you can call`],
    ['06:56', `it art like my brother is an artist and`],
    ['06:57', `he's like really picky about what you`],
    ['06:59', `can call art and I have this very`],
    ['07:02', `generic like super broad definition of`],
    ['07:04', `art that I talk about this programming`],
    ['07:06', `art but it's I mean it doesn't have it's`],
    ['07:11', `purely exploratory right within then it`],
    ['07:14', `uses too I could use as a medium to`],
    ['07:17', `explore a concept right so it's kind of`],
    ['07:21', `like what what is it it feels very arty`],
    ['07:24', `yeah I mean in a sense like when someone`],
    ['07:27', `paints a picture or you know makes a`],
    ['07:29', `movie that might be about exploring like`],
    ['07:32', `you know maybe a feeling or a topic or`],
    ['07:35', `something like that and it might be that`],
    ['07:37', `like you know it's it's just a pathway`],
    ['07:39', `into that you see this painting and you`],
    ['07:41', `go like oh that's so interesting like`],
    ['07:43', `what is the story behind it and then you`],
    ['07:46', `start diving into that top and maybe`],
    ['07:49', `it's about the artist or maybe sometimes`],
    ['07:51', `it's about what they painted maybe they`],
    ['07:53', `painted like a beautiful place in a town`],
    ['07:56', `far away and you go like oh I wonder`],
    ['07:58', `what it's like over there yeah and I`],
    ['07:59', `think in that sense this project is a`],
    ['08:01', `little bit like art because it's you`],
    ['08:03', `know it's it's a window into like`],
    ['08:05', `evolution and you might start like in`],
    ['08:07', `one end and then you might become`],
    ['08:08', `interested in what oh I wonder how that`],
    ['08:11', `works I wonder how it works in nature`],
    ['08:12', `maybe I want to read a little bit about`],
    ['08:14', `it or maybe watch some YouTube videos or`],
    ['08:16', `something like this so yeah in that`],
    ['08:19', `sense I would say it's a little bit of`],
    ['08:20', `art yeah I mean a product might also not`],
    ['08:24', `be defined by its like its its outcome`],
    ['08:29', `in sense that it might be it fun to`],
    ['08:33', `explore a restraint right`],
    ['08:36', `we back in the day when I was really`],
    ['08:40', `into TV production we had this team that`],
    ['08:43', `over the years have worked for a long`],
    ['08:45', `time we started out I was like happy`],
    ['08:47', `amateurs and after a while people like`],
    ['08:49', `gone off to school and learn like learn`],
    ['08:53', `the proper way to make movies basically`],
    ['08:55', `and a problem with that was that people`],
    ['08:59', `then learn how hard things were it's`],
    ['09:03', `when you start out you just like yeah`],
    ['09:06', `we're gonna do like this comedy show yes`],
    ['09:09', `like then it's just ludicrous like a`],
    ['09:11', `diluted curse ambitious do you for`],
    ['09:13', `someone that doesn't know it but we`],
    ['09:15', `managed to do it because we did not know`],
    ['09:17', `what the we were getting into yeah`],
    ['09:19', `so we just like oh no we're stuck and`],
    ['09:22', `the the kind of normally the sunk cost`],
    ['09:27', `fallacy is a horrible thing that you`],
    ['09:29', `should like not fall into but as you're`],
    ['09:34', `getting into something and you're not`],
    ['09:36', `that and you're like just learning`],
    ['09:38', `something it's kind of useful I think it`],
    ['09:41', `has evolved for a reason that you just`],
    ['09:43', `like okay yeah okay this was not a good`],
    ['09:46', `idea to learn this but yeah now I'm in`],
    ['09:49', `it and I wanna like actually actually`],
    ['09:51', `finish it I think it's possible that`],
    ['09:53', `humans if we didn't have the Sun cost`],
    ['09:55', `fallacy humans might like be overwhelmed`],
    ['09:58', `by the pain of learning something new`],
    ['10:00', `yeah or just quit too early yeah exactly`],
    ['10:02', `it's just like nobody would even the`],
    ['10:05', `projects that should be completed would`],
    ['10:07', `not be completed yeah I think I mean`],
    ['10:09', `Navitus there is a similar in this way I`],
    ['10:11', `mean a friend was asking me about advice`],
    ['10:14', `about starting a company and I mean I`],
    ['10:17', `I'm no businessman but like the one`],
    ['10:21', `thing I would say about you know`],
    ['10:23', `starting something new is that being`],
    ['10:25', `naive about it is actually to your`],
    ['10:28', `benefit because if you know all of the`],
    ['10:30', `stuff that you're gonna have to do`],
    ['10:31', `knowing you're gonna look at it you're`],
    ['10:33', `gonna go like oh okay wow that is way`],
    ['10:36', `too much but if you start and you kind`],
    ['10:38', `of like oh I I can figure it out I don't`],
    ['10:40', `know anything about it but I'm just`],
    ['10:41', `gonna start in one and then that's`],
    ['10:43', `really to your benefit and then along`],
    ['10:45', `the way you're gonna discover like small`],
    ['10:47', `problems and you go solve them and then`],
    ['10:49', `hopefully get all the way to them yeah`],
    ['10:52', `oh god that is such a good insight like`],
    ['10:55', `in pausing naïveté to just power`],
    ['10:59', `yourself through I guess throwing`],
    ['11:01', `yourself into a project and then like`],
    ['11:03', `getting yourself stuck in it and then`],
    ['11:05', `you think that's darkness too like`],
    ['11:08', `completed there is such a painful`],
    ['11:10', `insight but it's I think it's generally`],
    ['11:13', `how you get things done because if you`],
    ['11:15', `start getting into like listing the`],
    ['11:17', `fears and disadvantages of something you`],
    ['11:19', `were gonna kill almost every project at`],
    ['11:22', `at the start of it yeah I think so but`],
    ['11:24', `what I wanted to get in get back to with`],
    ['11:27', `us like learning how hard things were we`],
    ['11:31', `let that to be us not doing much movies`],
    ['11:34', `at all so to torpedo us out of this`],
    ['11:38', `mindset I started this project called`],
    ['11:40', `initiative called 8:00 a.m. sharp and`],
    ['11:42', `the idea was that we met every every`],
    ['11:46', `Saturday morning 8:00 a.m. sharp and we`],
    ['11:50', `were not allowed to have any script or`],
    ['11:52', `even an ID and like we were allowed to`],
    ['11:54', `have sort of an idea I think and at 6:00`],
    ['12:00', `p.m. I believe the same day we were`],
    ['12:02', `supposed to have a finished movie`],
    ['12:03', `uploaded on YouTube all right`],
    ['12:05', `that was the reception like make it make`],
    ['12:07', `a movie in a day and make it like every`],
    ['12:09', `other week and the thing is like this`],
    ['12:12', `was also an event where everyone was`],
    ['12:14', `welcome basically as anyone could show`],
    ['12:16', `up Mico of like in our circle of friends`],
    ['12:18', `and that meant that and also like they`],
    ['12:22', `brought gear so sometimes we had like`],
    ['12:26', `this huge team of two we had two onset`],
    ['12:30', `teams divided into different locations`],
    ['12:32', `but and on some days we had like two`],
    ['12:37', `people and a cell phone camera but like`],
    ['12:41', `the rule was like always make do with`],
    ['12:43', `what you have we're gonna make a movie`],
    ['12:45', `and we're gonna make it hell or high`],
    ['12:46', `water all right yeah I mean there's a`],
    ['12:49', `there's a good`],
    ['12:50', `anecdotes from the Jack white artists I`],
    ['12:55', `used to really love the white stripes`],
    ['12:57', `and I learned everything I could about`],
    ['12:58', `them and then one thing that he was`],
    ['13:00', `saying was that he had talked as well`],
    ['13:04', `about like restrictions and how that can`],
    ['13:06', `breed creativity I was saying that on`],
    ['13:08', `stage what he would do would be to`],
    ['13:10', `always move his instruments a bit`],
    ['13:13', `further out so that it would be harder`],
    ['13:15', `for him to get to them as he would have`],
    ['13:17', `to switch between all these instruments`],
    ['13:18', `on live set and it was just so`],
    ['13:21', `fascinating to me that like in what a`],
    ['13:23', `world artist would do something like`],
    ['13:24', `that to himself yeah make it harder so`],
    ['13:27', `that you could be more interesting and`],
    ['13:29', `more creative with it it's amazing yeah`],
    ['13:33', `I think that programming tools are way`],
    ['13:36', `too focused on making things easier and`],
    ['13:41', `more productive right like it would be`],
    ['13:44', `so like I read this article where`],
    ['13:46', `somebody was like what's it like to work`],
    ['13:48', `without version control it was because`],
    ['13:52', `he had like this code like this coding`],
    ['13:54', `Tamara went on an iPad and then her`],
    ['13:55', `version control and yes like huh this is`],
    ['13:58', `interesting I wonder what this will do`],
    ['13:59', `with my coding yeah now that I kind of I`],
    ['14:02', `because it was an era without version`],
    ['14:04', `control I worked without version control`],
    ['14:06', `for four years because it wasn't like a`],
    ['14:08', `big thing like deploying through FTP and`],
    ['14:12', `like a nice copying like oh we're`],
    ['14:14', `copying like it's now a sip yeah yeah`],
    ['14:21', `that would dark ages`],
    ['14:23', `so much time wasted version control is a`],
    ['14:25', `really good thing but working without it`],
    ['14:29', `has this interesting side effect you`],
    ['14:31', `just start programming it very`],
    ['14:32', `defensively and what he found himself`],
    ['14:35', `working in this super small units that`],
    ['14:37', `he didn't have to change a lot so he`],
    ['14:39', `just broke extract like extreme function`],
    ['14:42', `extraction into files so like everything`],

    ['17:00', `can be problem-solving yeah but I think`],
    ['17:03', `in my opinion it can also be extremely`],

    ['17:21', `like the it's such an incredibly`],
    ['17:24', `creative tool but at the same time it`],
    ['17:27', `can also be this tool where you it's`],
    ['17:29', `only like a very simple hammer and used`],
    ['17:32', `to go fix a very simple problem with it`],
    ['17:34', `that's sucked that's that's`],
    ['17:35', `really interesting you know it's we take`],
    ['17:43', `interviews like the the thing that we`],
    ['17:45', `used to qualify is this a good engineer`],
    ['17:46', `to let in to our companies they're very`],
    ['17:48', `problem oriented they really like less`],
    ['17:53', `like okay implement sort of like`],
    ['17:55', `quicksort right there don't I don't`],
    ['17:57', `think people do that anymore but it's`],
    ['17:59', `like solve this problem and in my`],

    ['18:07', `software teams in in organizations where`],
    ['18:12', `I've worked had been people that are`],
    ['18:13', `pretty innovative and a good at like ok`],
    ['18:17', `what what if we just do brow it's I mean`],
    ['18:24', `it's a little bit like you know painting`],
    ['18:26', `that you know you might if you're a`],
    ['18:29', `company and you paint walls or do you`],
    ['18:31', `paint in general and you bite area`],
    ['18:32', `people and you give them a Russian if I`],
    ['18:34', `can use this and then some of them might`],

    ['18:38', `yeah but then you know if you want to`],
    ['18:41', `create art or like you want to create`],
    ['18:43', `something that is not just solving with`],

    ['18:48', `paint then it's the same tool but but`],
    ['18:51', `it's it's a it's the combination of`],

    ['18:56', `and I think the program is so it's such`],
    ['18:58', `a wide spectrum of this like it's really`],
    ['19:01', `like a paintbrush you can go all the way`],
    ['19:03', `from simple to super complex yeah I`],
    ['19:05', `think that I think you might also be`],
    ['19:08', `covered a little bit by how`],
    ['19:10', `organizations divide themselves they`],
    ['19:12', `kind of like programmers or chop into`],

    ['19:25', `really hope that`],
    ['19:26', `we find ourselves in a reality where you`],
    ['19:28', `can wecan great men make programming`],
    ['19:31', `more high-level so that it's more`],
    ['19:33', `accessible to people that are of greater`],
    ['19:36', `profession so that there's actually you`],
    ['19:38', `don't have to spend so much time on`],
    ['19:41', `early programming that you also have`],
    ['19:43', `space for another craft like design or`],
    ['19:45', `or is there something like that yeah I'm`],
    ['19:47', `for sure I mean learning programming is`],
    ['19:49', `really like that you mean first you`],
    ['19:50', `learn how to use the tool but then you`],
    ['19:53', `also have to learn how to be creative`],
    ['19:55', `with it or how to like solve problems`],
    ['19:58', `that aren't just like you know how do I`],
    ['20:01', `take this data and move it from here to`],
    ['20:03', `here and these types of problems yeah`],
    ['20:10', `miss take a look what's with what were`],
    ['20:13', `we talking about we were talking about`],
    ['20:16', `like projects that or that we create`],
    ['20:21', `without the need for a specific outcome`],
    ['20:25', `we don't do this like okay we're gonna`],
    ['20:28', `solve this problem in the world or we`],
    ['20:30', `wanna I need to make money for my house`],
    ['20:33', `right it's uh yeah I I'm not sure to run`],
    ['20:38', `is exactly what the conclusions around`],
    ['20:40', `this pretty sorry yeah I mean I think`],
    ['20:42', `it's it's I think it's good I think it's`],
    ['20:45', `you know perhaps that take away is that`],
    ['20:47', `the chemical to do these things`],
    ['20:50', `sometimes where you kind of let yourself`],
    ['20:53', `be curious and you know explore`],
    ['20:54', `something sometimes I mean a lot of`],
    ['20:57', `times especially for me like I know a`],
    ['20:59', `lot of times it doesn't lead to anything`],
    ['21:01', `that's particularly interesting but then`],
    ['21:03', `again like it's sometimes you come to`],
    ['21:06', `something interesting and also like just`],
    ['21:08', `the process of exploring is in itself`],
    ['21:12', `like a bit of a gift I think it's it's`],
    ['21:14', `this sense of being in the landscape`],
    ['21:16', `that I've never seen before`],
    ['21:17', `yeah and also exploring it's a bit`],
    ['21:19', `different from learning because learning`],
    ['21:21', `is more like then you can take a course`],
    ['21:23', `like thinking like okay I'm gonna take`],
    ['21:26', `this paved path that somebody that`],
    ['21:28', `thinks this is the way of learning`],
    ['21:30', `typescript or WebGL has taught me`],
    ['21:34', `exploring is more like okay now I kinda`],
    ['21:38', `learn no this`],
    ['21:40', `what can I do with it that I haven't`],
    ['21:43', `done before that maybe no one has ever`],
    ['21:45', `done before`],
    ['21:46', `okay I combine this with this other`],
    ['21:49', `weird tool that I also happened to know`],
    ['21:51', `and or how can I apply this to this`],
    ['21:54', `weird problem is that even possible and`],
    ['21:57', `I think it's actually a great way to`],
    ['21:59', `learn programming in the first place is`],
    ['22:02', `I mean for me that was really the path`],
    ['22:04', `of learning programming just being`],
    ['22:06', `curious about like what I could do even`],
    ['22:09', `when I had oh when I knew almost nothing`],
    ['22:12', `I mean I could`],
    ['22:13', `there's someone showed me how to the you`],
    ['22:15', `know write three lines of quick basic`],
    ['22:18', `back in the stone Age's and with that`],
    ['22:21', `you know like I could put things`],
    ['22:23', `together and like it didn't make any`],
    ['22:25', `sense but the sense of time exploration`],
    ['22:27', `and going like oh why was I combine it`],
    ['22:29', `like this and what happens and that was`],
    ['22:31', `a great way to like learn programming`],
    ['22:34', `yeah I think that's yeah so I think that`],
    ['22:37', `the the first leg that we talked about`],
    ['22:41', `and then we talked about instead of that`],
    ['22:45', `was exploration and then there was also`],
    ['22:49', `limitation like posting yourself like`],
    ['22:52', `creating starting to explore how what is`],
    ['22:56', `it like to create in a limited setting`],
    ['22:58', `like what happens if you disable version`],
    ['23:00', `control what happens if you work without`],
    ['23:04', `like what happens if you work in a much`],
    ['23:06', `simpler editor than you do like what`],
    ['23:08', `what like if you don't have static`],
    ['23:11', `typing if you don't and if you don't`],
    ['23:12', `have unit testing what if those tools`],
    ['23:15', `were not invented and you could not`],
    ['23:16', `invent them for some reason I don't do`],
    ['23:18', `to like I don't know patents what what`],
    ['23:20', `would you create if you didn't have an`],
    ['23:23', `internet connection`],
    ['23:24', `oh yeah that is true yeah that's like oh`],
    ['23:29', `my god must be impossible I was saying`],
    ['23:31', `now to actually write a program without`],
    ['23:33', `an internet connection`],
    ['23:34', `yeah because we're so dependent on`],
    ['23:36', `dependent on`],
    ['23:39', `like basically just npm yeah I mean I`],
    ['23:42', `don't know how many times like the way I`],
    ['23:44', `program is that I come to a problem and`],
    ['23:47', `I'm good at googling like that's my most`],
    ['23:50', `important skill as a programmer but I`],
    ['23:53', `know how to search for the solution to a`],
    ['23:55', `problem if you don't have Google how`],
    ['23:57', `would you do it yeah yes you come to a`],
    ['23:59', `point in you like oh okay but I actually`],
    ['24:02', `accidentally had a sort of experience`],
    ['24:05', `like this in a company where like there`],
    ['24:09', `was this software it was written in`],
    ['24:11', `small talk and it was like compat`],
    ['24:13', `compiled down to this binary file and it`],
    ['24:15', `didn't have the source code no`],
    ['24:18', `so but it was a critical part of their`],
    ['24:20', `business processes so I basically had to`],
    ['24:23', `but they did have input and output files`],
    ['24:25', `so I could provide it with an input file`],
    ['24:29', `and an output file`],
    ['24:30', `I see like back and see what that output`],
    ['24:33', `produce and then I could match that with`],
    ['24:35', `the rewrites that I was making`],
    ['24:38', `interesting so it's kinda like this`],
    ['24:40', `became weird type of game and it could`],
    ['24:45', `also create kind of created like a`],
    ['24:47', `complete I had to invent a completely`],
    ['24:48', `new way of solving problems that I`],
    ['24:50', `hadn't that's it then that sighs nicely`],
    ['24:53', `back to neural networks I think because`],
    ['24:54', `if you had enough of those input about`],
    ['24:56', `the file so you could actually use to`],
    ['24:57', `train precisely that is actually like an`],
    ['25:00', `amazing point I think probably to be`],
    ['25:03', `honest had that amount of information`],
    ['25:05', `because it was a catalog company that`],
    ['25:07', `had years and years and years worth of`],
    ['25:09', `data so yeah you could probably train on`],
    ['25:14', `your left work on that that would be I`],
    ['25:16', `would be so interesting that I should`],
    ['25:19', `definitely have done that if I was there`],
    ['25:21', `now to spend their time it was a`],
    ['25:24', `horrible horrible company to work for`],
    ['25:28', `what like they're actually actually`],
    ['25:31', `bankrupt now actually said sorry yeah I`],
