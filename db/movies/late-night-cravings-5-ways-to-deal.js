    ['00:00', `Hey, if it's your first time here, my name is [Sadia]. I'm a registered dietitian and nutritionist. Welcome to the Pick Up Limes channel`],
    ['00:09', `now how many times in the last month have you finished eating dinner only to find that you're opening the fridge or`],
    ['00:15', `Looking through your pantry for something else to snack on only a couple hours later`],
    ['00:19', `Now I've worked with a lot of clients who?`],
    ['00:22', `struggle with late-night eating and they've shared with me some of the things that they've heard along the way`],
    ['00:27', `so the tips things like brush your teeth after you have dinner or go for a walk, listen to some music, read a book or`],
    ['00:35', `Probably one of the strangest ones I've heard was get naked in front of a mirror just to realize how little you need that snack`],
    ['00:41', `Now don't get me wrong some of these strategies`],
    ['00:44', `I'm sure work great for some people, but again what I was hearing was in the long-term`],
    ['00:48', `They really couldn't keep up with any of these tips so what I hope to do with you`],
    ['00:52', `Now is to share. Maybe some more realistic strategies to help you with those late-night food cravings`],
    ['01:00', `Now this one doesn't mean to gorge it. Just means to eat until you're comfortably full`],
    ['01:06', `Sometimes what a lot of people will do is they'll skimp out on dinner thinking. I already ate too much today`],
    ['01:12', `Only to find that they are elbow-deep in a bag of chips not so long after`],
    ['01:17', `Now I can almost guarantee to you that`],
    ['01:20', `the nutrient content of your dinner is higher and the Calorie content is lower if you have a`],
    ['01:26', `Suitable serving of dinner that really fills you up compared to if you don't eat enough`],
    ['01:30', `But then you end up binging on a very high Calorie and low nutrient snack food later on`],
    ['01:39', `Some people eat dinner at 5 p.m.`],
    ['01:41', `And then we don't sleep until the midnight`],
    ['01:43', `And then they give themselves a really hard time for having a food craving at some point in between that time`],
    ['01:48', `That's a seven-hour gap`],
    ['01:50', `It is absolutely realistic and reasonable that you get hungry between them now if you're somebody whose time gap is shorter than that`],
    ['01:57', `Maybe eat dinner later you go to sleep earlier`],
    ['02:00', `You're still having a comfortably filling dinner, and you're still craving something`],
    ['02:05', `And I would say certainly go for it`],
    ['02:07', `Just plan for it and snack smart if you can anticipate that you're going to be wanting something`],
    ['02:13', `You can plan for it by making sure that you shop for the ingredients`],
    ['02:16', `and have the snack foods on hand that you know you'll want [so] be nourishing for your mind your body and your soul all`],
    ['02:23', `While leaving that feeling of guilt behind that feeling of guilt that we usually feel when we eat when it was mindless`],
    ['02:30', `Unplanned and usually the least nutrient dense food that we could find in our house`],
    ['02:35', `Now ask yourself this or even write it down. What kind of food in the evenings`],
    ['02:40', `Do you usually reach for, is it something salty?`],
    ['02:44', `sweet`],
    ['02:46', `savory`],
    ['02:47', `Crunchy or maybe warm and comforting now`],
    ['02:51', `We're all very individual and what we reach for but as long as you`],
    ['02:54', `know what want it is that you go for you can plan to have a snack on hand that you feel will be nourishing and`],
    ['03:00', `satisfying for when that late-night hunger strikes`],
    ['03:08', `Now we eat food because it tastes delicious obviously so we also eat food to give us energy`],
    ['03:14', `Now if you're somebody who doesn't sleep enough you might find your evening food cravings particularly intense`],
    ['03:20', `Especially for sweets, starchy foods, different kinds of carbs like that`],
    ['03:25', `Other reason for that is your brain is trying to keep you stimulated in awake`],
    ['03:28', `And the brain's preferred and primary energy source is carbohydrates. Totally natural, no problem there`],
    ['03:36', `So the question, then is are you getting enough sleep?`],
    ['03:38', `I know it's easier said than done`],
    ['03:41', `But I had one client that was very surprised to`],
    ['03:44', `Realize how easy it was just to get an extra hour sleep simply by giving up watching the evening news`],
    ['03:49', `Given she was watching [the] morning news anyway while getting ready for work with a question to ask yourself here is`],
    ['03:56', `Can you catch some extra z's either by sleeping a little bit earlier or hey? You [can] waken up a little bit later [now]`],
    ['04:06', `[does] anyone here not drink enough fluids?`],
    ['04:09', `But I'm totally one of those people so [I] am not going to judge one of the problems here`],
    ['04:14', `Is [that] we very often confuse thirst for hunger if you're finding that you think you're hungry?`],
    ['04:20', `[ask] yourself first when was the last time [I] had something to drink if it was quite a while ago`],
    ['04:26', `I would recommend having a cup or two of either water or tea and then wait a few minutes about 10 minutes or so and`],
    ['04:32', `See if you're still hungry`],
    ['04:33', `Now if you're one of those people look like [now], I don't like water and I don't like tea. That's okay`],
    ['04:37', `You can have something a little [bit] [more] filling and nourishing. Maybe a soup`],
    ['04:40', `Smoothie my personal favorite is making my version of a london fog`],
    ['04:44', `Which is just heated up soy milk with an earl [grey] tea bag and a Sprinkle of cinnamon`],
    ['04:49', `Super comforting and nutritious`],
    ['04:52', `but even after`],
    ['04:53', `Hydrating if you find you're still hungry and in that case go for it and now at least you've got some extra Fluid, Zinnias`],
    ['05:02', `Now I am all for giving [in] to hunger`],
    ['05:04', `I think that truly listening to our bodies is one of the best things that we can do now`],
    ['05:09', `Ask yourself when you're hungry [am] I eating to nourish my body mind soul`],
    ['05:15', `Or am I doing it because it's self sabotaging in some way whether I'm eating completely mindlessly or because of some kind of emotional distress`],
    ['05:23', `Now if you're eating because you're truly hungry`],
    ['05:25', `And you want to nourish yourself please of course go for it and the most important point here being`],
    ['05:31', `Enjoy it this can best be done if all of our attention is put on that particular food that we are going to enjoy`],
    ['05:39', `Take your time and savor every bite`],
    ['05:42', `I would highly advise to turn off any kind of distractions or get away from them this includes screens like TVS computers`],
    ['05:50', `tablets and phones`],
    ['05:52', `By doing this you allow yourself to enjoy eating something. That's truly pleasurable without the risk of whole routine`],
    ['06:03', `All right, so that's a wrap those are the five different ways that you can cope with late-night food cravings`],
    ['06:08', `But if you're somebody who finds that your cravings are probably Borderline?`],
    ['06:12', `binge eating or full-out binge eating [I] have made a previous video on that and how to cobol I'll link it here if`],
    ['06:19', `You also have some strategies or tips that work for you that I didn't mention please share them in the comment [section] below`],
    ['06:25', `Sharing is caring`],
    ['06:26', `And I'm certain a lot of people would benefit from what you have to say and I would certainly love to read about them`],
    ['06:32', `Subscribe as well if you haven't already so you don't miss out on any future?`],
    ['06:35', `Videos and one of the future videos by the way will be about different kind of snack ideas`],
    ['06:39', `Falling into the categories of sweet salty savory crunchy and [warming] comforting as I mentioned before and I will put the link to it`],
