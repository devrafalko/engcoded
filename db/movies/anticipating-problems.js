    ['05:19', `of mammals do it's a pretty simple thing`],
    ['05:20', `but it's like that's one of the things`],

    ['05:35', `walk on the ice because it might break`],
    ['05:38', `you know and what all these old threats`],
    ['05:42', `of the old world`],
    ['05:44', `is that they were low in complexity so`],
    ['05:48', `they were easy to reason about and they`],

    ['05:58', `possible threats because like we would`],
    ['06:02', `die if if they came to be but the`],
    ['06:07', `problem with using a brain which is`],
    ['06:10', `built for this and apply it to something`],
    ['06:12', `it's like software development or`],
    ['06:14', `something at like moving cities or`],

    ['06:50', `course it's bad like we're gonna lose`],
    ['06:52', `revenue because our customers are gonna`],
    ['06:54', `be angry with us perhaps like we're`],
    ['06:59', `actually gonna lose money in a real way`],
    ['07:02', `and people are perhaps like like a worse`],
    ['07:04', `going to get fire but generally unless`],
    ['07:07', `you're doing some kind of medical or`],
    ['07:09', `medical software or running a nuclear`],
    ['07:13', `power plant or something like this in`],
    ['07:15', `which case this episode does not apply`],

    ['07:22', `threats are going to be pretty pretty`],
    ['07:24', `low risk compared to people dying this`],
    ['07:28', `is of course nothing new that I'm saying`],
    ['07:30', `here like a lot of software developers`],
    ['07:32', `are yapping on about it all the time and`],
    ['07:35', `I'm gonna Yap about run on about it`],
    ['07:37', `today as well because it's because it's`],
    ['07:39', `a way that our brains are built`],
    ['07:42', `it's a bug in our brain so we need to be`],

    ['08:01', `out of this mindset and premature`],
    ['08:06', `optimization is the root of all evil`],
    ['08:08', `talks about like when you start Jesus`],
    ['08:11', `Christ start doing optimizations of your`],
    ['08:16', `code like oh my god this piece of code`],
    ['08:18', `is so inefficient but in reality the`],
    ['08:21', `problem is that that code is only hit a`],
    ['08:24', `couple of times per second which doesn't`],
    ['08:27', `really affect the performance of your`],
    ['08:30', `application at all while another part of`],
    ['08:33', `the code that looks or is a way more`],
    ['08:37', `efficient is hit like four thousand`],
    ['08:40', `times a second and that's the part that`],
    ['08:44', `needed optimization but you didn't`],
    ['08:46', `really know that until the point like`],
    ['08:48', `the the application was in production or`],
    ['08:51', `until you actually started like`],
    ['08:53', `profiling it on on actual users using`],
    ['08:56', `the actual software and the reason why`],
    ['08:59', `you didn't see it is that the system or`],
    ['09:02', `the yeah the system it's just so complex`],
    ['09:06', `it's your brain is built for like yeah`],
    ['09:09', `crops and tigers and bushes and`],
    ['09:12', `like it cannot really like ink do deal`],

    ['09:29', `optimization is the root of all evil and`],
    ['09:32', `doesn't mean that optimization is bad it`],
    ['09:33', `means that you should be wary of doing`],

    ['10:26', `complexity and rather low danger come`],
    ['10:31', `compared to what your meat computer is`],
    ['10:36', `it's tuned for so you're going to give`],
    ['10:42', `too much weight to the threats but most`],
    ['10:45', `importantly and and what what I is`],
    ['10:49', `really the important thing in this this`],
    ['10:51', `case is that you simply cannot predict`],
    ['10:54', `what's gonna happen you're gonna make`],
    ['10:56', `incorrect predictions the threats that`],
    ['10:58', `you're gonna anticipate are probably not`],
    ['11:02', `going to happen what's going to happen`],

    ['11:08', `those completely different things the`],
    ['11:09', `unknown unknowns that I would like to`],
    ['11:13', `that I would like to focus on because if`],

    ['11:29', `the problems up front before we get into`],
    ['11:33', `things if we always have these unknowns`],
    ['11:34', `and then what to do well you just have`],
    ['11:39', `to be very good at receiving problems`],
    ['11:45', `like catching them like the you're going`],
    ['11:48', `to life is gonna throw you curveballs`],
    ['11:50', `all the time I love Murphy's Law that if`],
    ['11:54', `something can go wrong it will go wrong`],
    ['11:56', `and I would like that I would like it to`],
    ['11:59', `have this I Edition that you you also`],
    ['12:03', `well not know what God it goes wrong`],
    ['12:05', `it's expressions like shits when`],

    ['12:18', `and you need to be good at dealing with`],
    ['12:23', `that as it comes along`],
    ['12:24', `so instead of trying to anticipate`],
    ['12:28', `everything single thing that can go`],
    ['12:30', `wrong when you're doing software`],
    ['12:32', `development it's it's very important to`],

    ['12:46', `deployment process having a ton of error`],
    ['12:48', `logging and exception logging having`],

    ['13:04', `not gonna be able to you're not gonna be`],
    ['13:06', `especially good at dealing with these`],
    ['13:10', `these unanticipated problems and the`],
    ['13:14', `problem is when they happen you cannot`],

    ['13:19', `think about this this hard enough we`],
    ['13:21', `didn't think about everything that can`],
    ['13:23', `happen why did anybody think of this no`],
    ['13:25', `you didn't think of it because the the`],

    ['13:30', `high complexity for you to think of it`],
    ['13:33', `the problem is not that you were care`],
