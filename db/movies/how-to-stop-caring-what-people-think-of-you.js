    ['00:05', `Hey guys!`],
    ['00:06', `So I am feeling sentimental today because it is Lavendaire's fifth birthday.`],
    ['00:11', `Yes, it's been five years since I started Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:15', `And as the fifth anniversary celebration, I wanted to revisit`],
    ['00:19', `the first video that I ever posted on Lavendaire, which was`],
    ['00:22', `"How to Stop Caring About What Others Think of You",`],
    ['00:26', `and kind of give my updates on my new thoughts after five years.`],
    ['00:31', `The reason I chose that topic as the first one to post on Lavendaire was`],
    ['00:34', `because it's a key foundational step to creating your dream life.`],
    ['00:40', `You have to let go and stop caring about what others think of you,`],
    ['00:45', `simply because if you are going to live your dream life,`],
    ['00:48', `you have to live for yourself and not others,`],
    ['00:51', `and that was a huge lesson that I had to learn in my early 20s.`],
    ['00:55', `And that's why it was so important for me to share that one first.`],
    ['00:59', `I had so many great points in the first video, which I'll recap really quickly right here.`],
    ['01:05', `So how do you stop caring about what other people think of you?`],
    ['01:08', `Well, #1: Learn not to take anything personally.`],
    ['01:13', `I learned this from the book "The Four Agreements".`],
    ['01:16', `The point is: If you don't take anything personally,`],
    ['01:20', `then you are immune and nothing and nobody can hurt you –`],
    ['01:23', `which brings me to #2: Love yourself.`],
    ['01:27', `You have to first and foremost love, embrace who you are and be super confident in that,`],
    ['01:33', `because you don't need other people to tell you what you're worth.`],
    ['01:37', `You should already know how wonderful and awesome you are.`],
    ['01:42', `It should come from within and that inner confidence is what shines,`],
    ['01:46', `and it's what kind of makes a statement.`],
    ['01:49', `#3 is to: Stop being paranoid.`],
    ['01:51', `Stop being paranoid.`],
    ['01:53', `We think that we're so important that people are always thinking about us`],
    ['01:57', `and talking about us, when in reality, most of the time,`],
    ['02:01', `other people are too busy worrying about themselves`],
    ['02:03', `and their own lives to even let you cross their mind.`],
    ['02:07', `#4: Don't waste your time and energy trying to explain yourself to others.`],
    ['02:12', `People already have an idea of what they want to believe,`],
    ['02:16', `and so they only hear what they want to hear.`],
    ['02:19', `And everything else is subconsciously filtered out,`],
    ['02:23', `so it's a waste of time and energy to try to convert one person,`],
    ['02:28', `one person's thought about you,`],
    ['02:30', `when you already have a set of people who love and accept you for who you are.`],
    ['02:34', `Honestly, when I look back at that video,`],
    ['02:36', `I was a little awkward and shy in front of the camera.`],
    ['02:39', `And I was recording in my tiny bedroom that had no natural light.`],
    ['02:43', `I always had to have artificial lighting.`],
    ['02:46', `But the content was good.`],
    ['02:48', `Those points are still so valid,`],
    ['02:51', `and it's so concise and simple that I'm like, "Yeah, I still believe that."`],
    ['02:56', `I've wanted to remake this video and re-address the topic,`],
    ['03:01', `but I feel like I already did a pretty good job.`],
    ['03:03', `To be honest, the core lessons are the same,`],
    ['03:05', `but now I can speak to the topic with more depth and more life experience.`],
    ['03:12', `Five years ago, when I created this video and I was learning this lesson,`],
    ['03:16', `it was because I was finding my way and I was trying to create my dream`],
    ['03:22', `instead of living out the dream that other people had for me –`],
    ['03:26', `my family wanted me to do certain things, my peers.`],
    ['03:29', `Society kind of pushes you in a certain direction`],
    ['03:32', `and I wanted to go outside of that direction,`],
    ['03:34', `so I really had to learn to be strong and believe in myself and forge my own path,`],
    ['03:40', `which is why I had to learn to shed all of that judgment.`],
    ['03:43', `Also, at the time I made this video, I was doing a lot of random, creative things.`],
    ['03:48', `My channel was really small, I had zero credibility,`],
    ['03:51', `and I felt like everyone was judging me for not being successful in their eyes.`],
    ['03:58', `I was a broke artist, basically.`],
    ['04:02', `And me coming from a background of going to business school at USC,`],
    ['04:05', `where all my peers were getting high-paying jobs straight out of college,`],
    ['04:08', `I had to learn to not care about what they thought of me`],
    ['04:12', `taking this really random broke route of being an artist.`],
    ['04:16', `So I had to learn that.`],
    ['04:18', `Fast-forward, here we are five years later,`],
    ['04:21', `where I am so grateful that I took that choice and took the risk to carve my own path.`],
    ['04:27', `I created Lavendaire, it's amazing, I have you guys here, and I just love my life.`],
    ['04:34', `I'm so happy and grateful to be here.`],
    ['04:36', `And you know what?`],
    ['04:38', `When you've become successful yourself, you believe in yourself so much that –`],
    ['04:41', `of course, everyone around me now supports me and believes in me.`],
    ['04:47', `But it came at a point where I didn't need it anymore,`],
    ['04:50', `because in the beginning you have to be the one to give yourself that support.`],
    ['04:54', `And you get everyone else's support when you're already a winner,`],
    ['04:57', `and you don't really need their support, but anyway –`],
    ['04:59', `I'm lucky now that I've grown, I have the support of my friends and family around me`],
    ['05:03', `and I've overcome that hump of not caring about`],
    ['05:07', `what this inner circle thinks or how people judge me.`],
    ['05:11', `And now, where I am in my journey,`],
    ['05:13', `I am still learning this lesson of how to stop caring about what others think of you.`],
    ['05:17', `But it's change in that now, it is me vs. the internet,`],
    ['05:22', `because when you put yourself out there online,`],
    ['05:25', `everybody's criticisms and judgment just magnifies –`],
    ['05:30', `and that is something that, in the past few years, I've learned to deal with.`],
    ['05:34', `I've just experienced so much criticism, judgment, misjudgments,`],
    ['05:39', `and I'm still learning to not try to defend myself or explain myself to everyone.`],
    ['05:45', `If they have a wrong impression of me or if someone criticizes me in some way,`],
    ['05:49', `I have to learn to let it go, rather than feel the urge to comment back`],
    ['05:53', `and defend myself and explain myself.`],
    ['05:55', `I'm sure you guys have seen mean comments everywhere on the internet.`],
    ['05:58', `It's not really the mean ones that hurt.`],
    ['06:00', `But the ones that hurt are the ones that have a little bit of truth in them, a little bit of –`],
    ['06:06', `you kind of agree with what they're saying, and it hurts.`],
    ['06:09', `Let me explain, for example:`],
    ['06:11', `The comments and criticisms that hurt the most are the ones that are like,`],
    ['06:14', `"You're not a real minimalist.`],
    ['06:16', `How can you call yourself a minimalist if you have so many things?"`],
    ['06:19', `or "You're so wasteful.`],
    ['06:21', `How can you make this video about reducing waste`],
    ['06:23', `when you have these lights in the background that are unnecessary?"`],
    ['06:27', `Basically, in areas that you care about and you're like,`],
    ['06:29', `"No, no, I do care! Let me explain myself!"`],
    ['06:32', `And at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you explain yourself or not.`],
    ['06:37', `People are going to judge you no matter what.`],
    ['06:39', `And with the internet, it's just amplified.`],
    ['06:41', `I'll get thousands of the same types of comments, misjudging me, and I'm like, "Ugh."`],
    ['06:46', `I can't answer every one, and it's pointless to.`],
    ['06:48', `And what I've learned is: People on the internet kind of hold you up to a very high expectation.`],
    ['06:53', `They expect you to be perfect, and if you're not perfect, there's something wrong with you.`],
    ['06:59', `And so they comment and criticize on what's wrong with you`],
    ['07:01', `because why are you not perfect?`],
    ['07:03', `And hearing these comments and criticisms,`],
    ['07:05', `I realize that the reason why they hurt is because they all boil down to a basic message:`],
    ['07:11', `You're not good enough.`],
    ['07:13', `And it hurts to hear that you're not good enough`],
    ['07:15', `because you and I both know that, even in our self talk,`],
    ['07:19', `we can get into that negative space where we tell ourselves, "I'm not good enough."`],
    ['07:23', `And it hurts even more when other people tell you you're not good enough.`],
    ['07:28', `And I realized, this is kind of the same thing when your peers and family around you`],
    ['07:33', `don't believe in your dreams, when they don't support what you're doing.`],
    ['07:36', `They're telling you: You're not good enough.`],
    ['07:39', `You can't go for that dream because you're not good enough.`],
    ['07:41', `What it really is, is: They're projecting their fear on you because they worry about you.`],
    ['07:47', `They don't want you to fail and get hurt.`],
    ['07:50', `And from these comments that I get – some of them are mean,`],
    ['07:53', `but some of them actually come with good intentions that push me to be better.`],
    ['07:57', `But it comes off in a way that says "You're not good enough",`],
    ['08:01', `and nobody needs to hear that.`],
    ['08:04', `Nobody needs to hear that you're not good enough.`],
    ['08:06', `And that's why it's so important to learn to shield yourself from other people's opinions`],
    ['08:10', `because people are always going to have an opinion.`],
    ['08:13', `People are always going to criticize, they're always going to judge you.`],
    ['08:16', `It's only natural, and at the end of the day,`],
    ['08:20', `what I've learned – what I'm still learning and practicing is:`],
    ['08:23', `The only thing that matters is what you think of yourself.`],
    ['08:27', `That's that.`],
    ['08:28', `If you approve of yourself, if you think you're doing okay,`],
    ['08:32', `if you live aligned to your own values and you're happy with yourself and everything,`],
    ['08:38', `then you're good.`],
    ['08:40', `The only time you need to change is when you don't feel like you're being your best.`],
    ['08:45', `It's not what other people are telling you, it has to come from within.`],
    ['08:48', `There is a part of us that wants to people-please.`],
    ['08:52', `There's a part of us that wants everyone to like us.`],
    ['08:55', `It's a part of being human because you want to be accepted into the tribe.`],
    ['08:59', `And also, depending on your childhood,`],
    ['09:01', `if you had a childhood where you had a lack of love and attention,`],
    ['09:04', `then you're going to want to seek that love, attention, and approval from others`],
    ['09:10', `by being a people-pleaser and saying yes to everybody.`],
    ['09:13', `But to live for yourself means to shed that need`],
    ['09:18', `and to give yourself all the love that you need`],
    ['09:21', `so that you don't seek it from people outside of yourself.`],
    ['09:25', `And if you can truly give yourself all the love and approval and acceptance that you need,`],
    ['09:30', `then it doesn't matter what other people say or think about you`],
    ['09:34', `because like I said, it only matters what you think about yourself.`],
    ['09:38', `I think that is one of the biggest breakthroughs in my life,`],
    ['09:41', `to learn to not live in what other people want for you`],
    ['09:44', `and what other people are telling you you should do,`],
    ['09:47', `but to actually listen to yourself and live the way that you want to live.`],
    ['09:52', `Honestly if I listened to all of the criticisms that I get on this channel,`],
    ['09:56', `I would probably change my hair color to whatever people are telling me to change it to.`],
    ['10:01', `I would be a perfect minimalist which – what does that even mean?`],
    ['10:05', `Or I would be a perfect zero waste person, which definitely, I'm not.`],
    ['10:10', `I would be a perfect vegan, which I'm not as well,`],
    ['10:13', `even though in these areas, I care and I'm making progress.`],
    ['10:17', `But nobody's perfect.`],
    ['10:18', `I'm not perfect, for sure.`],
    ['10:20', `And what I've learned from all of this is how important it is`],
    ['10:23', `to strive for progress, not perfection.`],
    ['10:27', `And recognize everyone's in a different point in their journey.`],
    ['10:31', `Some people are further along than others.`],
    ['10:33', `Respect everyone and their journeys.`],
    ['10:37', `Do not judge anyone because their story is completely different from you`],
    ['10:41', `and you don't know all the circumstances.`],
    ['10:44', `And celebrate each other because we're all just doing the very best that we can.`],
    ['10:49', `We only hurt each other when we judge each other, criticize, and bring each other down.`],
    ['10:53', `And what we really all need is more love and support in our lives,`],
    ['10:57', `for ourselves and from the people around us.`],
    ['11:00', `Most importantly is to understand that nobody's perfect`],
    ['11:02', `and what you want to do is not feel bad for not being perfect,`],
    ['11:07', `but embrace your imperfection, embrace where you are in your journey,`],
    ['11:12', `love and accept yourself where you are.`],
    ['11:15', `And you can still love yourself and want to be better.`],
    ['11:17', `There's nothing wrong with that.`],
    ['11:19', `And next time you recognize that voice that's telling you "You're not good enough",`],
    ['11:23', `whether it's coming from your family, your peers, the internet, or yourself,`],
    ['11:29', `remind yourself that you are good enough.`],
    ['11:32', `You are good enough where you are.`],
    ['11:34', `You're amazing as you are right now in your imperfect state.`],
    ['11:38', `As long as you're doing the best that you can and you approve of yourself,`],
    ['11:43', `that's all that matters.`],
    ['11:44', `And now I want to end with this quote that I heard from Amber Scholl:`],
    ['11:47', `"There's only two people in the world you need to impress:`],
    ['11:50', `your 5 year old self and your 80 year old self."`],
    ['11:54', `Think about that, journal on it, and love yourself.`],
    ['11:58', `That's that.`],
    ['11:59', `Who cares about what other people are thinking.`],
    ['12:01', `People see the world through their own filter and you can't change that.`],
    ['12:05', `So the best you can do is not let it hurt you, and just let it go.`],
    ['12:10', `Let it be, and live your best life.`],
    ['12:12', `Alright, love you guys so much.`],
    ['12:14', `I hope you liked this video.`],
    ['12:15', `Happy 5th birthday to Lavendaire.`],
