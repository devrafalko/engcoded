    ['00:09', `Hey everyone!`],
    ['00:10', `Welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:11', `It's Aileen.`],
    ['00:12', `One of my favorite parts of creating your dream life`],
    ['00:14', `is having financial freedom and creating financial abundance.`],
    ['00:19', `That means having enough money so that you don't have to worry`],
    ['00:22', `or stress about how you're going to pay your bills,`],
    ['00:25', `having more than enough money so that you can live comfortably and happily.`],
    ['00:29', `To make it super simple:`],
    ['00:30', `Two ways to make more money is to 1) make more money, or 2) save more money.`],
    ['00:36', `So today I've partnered up with Ebates to share`],
    ['00:38', `15 ways that you can save more money in your life.`],
    ['00:42', `So let's start with 1) Use cash instead of credit cards.`],
    ['00:47', `We live in a digital culture where it's so easy to swipe your credit cards,`],
    ['00:50', `buy something online, even pay your friends back using your phone,`],
    ['00:54', `that we sometimes don't realize how much we are spending.`],
    ['00:58', `It just looks like a random number and you're like, "Okay, click click click."`],
    ['01:01', `It's super easy.`],
    ['01:02', `So using cash instead of using your credit card will help you realize how much you're spending,`],
    ['01:08', `and when you see that amount of money in cash,`],
    ['01:11', `it just seems like so much more money because of the physical paper.`],
    ['01:15', `It just feels more substantial and more real.`],
    ['01:18', `Also, when you use cash, you're spending money that you already have.`],
    ['01:22', `And when you use credit cards, you're kind of using borrowed money,`],
    ['01:25', `money that you don't have to pay at that moment and that can be very dangerous:`],
    ['01:30', `making you spend more than you actually have and you can go down that slippery slope`],
    ['01:34', `of getting into credit card debt which is the worst type of debt to be in`],
    ['01:39', `because it's so high interest and you're just going to be paying so much extra money`],
    ['01:43', `that just does not make sense.`],
    ['01:44', `It's not smart.`],
    ['01:46', `Pay your full credit card bills off, you guys.`],
    ['01:49', `2) Write down all of your spending, all of your expenses, on paper.`],
    ['01:54', `Take time to look at your past transactions and really keep track of how much you're spending.`],
    ['01:59', `See where your money's going.`],
    ['02:00', `How much are you spending on food?`],
    ['02:01', `How much are you spending on Amazon or groceries?`],
    ['02:05', `It can surprise you, and this is your chance to bring awareness to this area`],
    ['02:10', `so that you can see where you can start to cut back.`],
    ['02:12', `From there you can start to set new budgets for yourself and kind of make it like a game.`],
    ['02:17', `See if you can spend maybe $100 less on food this month`],
    ['02:20', `or whatever categories you think you might be overspending in.`],
    ['02:25', `This brings me to my next point which is 3) Cancel any unnecessary subscriptions.`],
    ['02:30', `You might just be subscribed to something that you don’t realize you're subscribed to`],
    ['02:35', `or something that you don't use anymore, that you can technically cancel or put on hold.`],
    ['02:40', `For example, I realized that I haven't shopped on Thrive Market as much anymore,`],
    ['02:44', `so I'm planning on cancelling that annual subscription.`],
    ['02:47', `And I also use Audible, but because I've collected so many credits for audiobooks over time,`],
    ['02:51', `I realized that I can actually downgrade my plan`],
    ['02:54', `into paying every other month for an audiobook, vs. every month.`],
    ['02:59', `So that suits me better and it saves me money.`],
    ['03:01', `4) Always Google a coupon code.`],
    ['03:04', `I can't tell you how many times I've saved money using this trick.`],
    ['03:07', `I never check out without Googling for a special promo code first`],
    ['03:12', `because I just know that there are so many promos and coupon codes out there.`],
    ['03:16', `So for example: There was this YouTube convention last year that was pretty pricey.`],
    ['03:20', `Say, the convention was $400 to attend.`],
    ['03:25', `I was about to pay that $400 to attend that event, but instead I was like,`],
    ['03:30', `"Hm, let me Google this and see if there's any coupon codes out there."`],
    ['03:34', `So I ended up finding this guy who was speaking at that event,`],
    ['03:38', `and he turned out to have a special code for his followers.`],
    ['03:41', `So I just took that code, inputted it, and my ticket came out to be half the price.`],
    ['03:45', `So I saved $200 just by a quick Google search.`],
    ['03:50', `Tip 5) Use Ebates to get cash back on your purchases.`],
    ['03:54', `You can actually get up to 15% cash back when you shop online through Ebates.`],
    ['03:59', `If you haven't heard of Ebates, it's the largest cash back site`],
    ['04:01', `which partners with over 2500 of the biggest name brands`],
    ['04:05', `like Sephora, Amazon, Adidas, Urban Outfitters, even Coursera,`],
    ['04:10', `to bring you cash back coupons and promo codes, all for free.`],
    ['04:15', `I've been using Ebates since 2015.`],
    ['04:17', `I love that it rewards you for shopping at places that you would normally already shop at.`],
    ['04:22', `So it's kind of a no-brainer to use.`],
    ['04:24', `It feels like free money.`],
    ['04:25', `Using Ebates is super easy.`],
    ['04:27', `I personally like to use the Google Chrome extension`],
    ['04:29', `so that whenever I'm doing some online shopping,`],
    ['04:32', `then there will be a pop-up letting me know if that shop has Ebates Cash Back.`],
    ['04:37', `So there's just a button that says "Activate Cash Back".`],
    ['04:40', `You click it and you're good to go.`],
    ['04:42', `You can also get cash back by shopping through the Ebates website.`],
    ['04:46', `When you go on the website, there are tons of brands.`],
    ['04:49', `You just click through it and then you'll be on the road to getting cash back that way as well.`],
    ['04:54', `If you want to sign up for Ebates, you can click that first link in my description box`],
    ['04:57', `for a $10 welcome bonus after you join for free, and there's also a giveaway.`],
    ['05:03', `So click that second link if you want to enter`],
    ['05:05', `my $100 Visa gift card giveaway, cosponsored by Ebates.`],
    ['05:10', `So you must be an Ebates member and subscribed to my channel to enter.`],
    ['05:14', `But it's free money.`],
    ['05:15', `How exciting, right?`],
    ['05:16', `Now for the sixth way to save more money: 6) Start building an emergency fund.`],
    ['05:20', `An emergency fund is a sum of money that is about 3-6 months-worth of your expenses.`],
    ['05:28', `So calculate your average monthly expenses and times that by 3-6.`],
    ['05:33', `It just depends on whatever number makes you feel good,`],
    ['05:37', `whatever number lets you sleep at night.`],
    ['05:39', `That is your emergency fund to dip into whenever there is an emergency.`],
    ['05:45', `The way you start building this is to make a plan`],
    ['05:48', `to start setting deposits to that emergency fund.`],
    ['05:52', `You can make this automatic, or it doesn't have to be automatic.`],
    ['05:55', `Start to consciously think of ways to save that money,`],
    ['05:58', `and then actively transfer it to your emergency fund.`],
    ['06:01', `Trust me, once you start thinking about it, the ideas will come and before you know it,`],
    ['06:06', `you'll be on the way to building that emergency fund safety net and you'll be good to go.`],
    ['06:11', `7) Schedule your shopping allowance.`],
    ['06:14', `This is a way to limit your shopping habits.`],
    ['06:17', `So instead of shopping whenever you feel like it`],
    ['06:19', `or whenever you're bored, set a schedule for your shopping.`],
    ['06:23', `Allow yourself to buy clothes once every other month or once every three months.`],
    ['06:28', `Maybe every quarter when there's a new season, that's your opportunity to start shopping.`],
    ['06:33', `Whatever, you make up the rules that work for you.`],
    ['06:36', `What you can do is start adding items to your shopping list.`],
    ['06:39', `Just use any list-making app,`],
    ['06:41', `and write down things that you want to buy as you think of them.`],
    ['06:45', `Don't buy them right then.`],
    ['06:46', `Just put them on your list like, "Oh, I need new socks," or "a new blender".`],
    ['06:51', `Put these all in your list and schedule a day in your calendar to let yourself shop.`],
    ['06:56', `That will help control any impulse buying.`],
    ['06:59', `And it will help you be a more calculated and planned-out shopper.`],
    ['07:04', `8) Wait it out.`],
    ['07:06', `So if you don't like the previous tip on scheduling your shopping allowance,`],
    ['07:09', `you can also apply this tip to "Wait it out".`],
    ['07:12', `Give yourself 14-30 days after you want to buy something to actually buy it.`],
    ['07:18', `This also helps curb that shopping impulse, if you don't do any impulsive shopping.`],
    ['07:23', `So when you want to buy something –`],
    ['07:25', `say you want to buy a new camera or a new laptop – really sit on it.`],
    ['07:30', `Don't buy it immediately.`],
    ['07:31', `Take your time, I would say 14-30 days.`],
    ['07:35', `And then after those days, if you still feel like you want to buy it then make your purchase.`],
    ['07:40', `That way, you'll make more informed and smart choices.`],
    ['07:44', `9) Only buy what you really need and what you'll really use.`],
    ['07:49', `I kind of want to counteract the popular belief`],
    ['07:52', `that shopping in bulk is a way to save more money.`],
    ['07:56', `Yes, in some cases, it is.`],
    ['07:58', `But I see a lot of people kind of go overboard with it,`],
    ['08:01', `people who like to save money like to buy bulk everything,`],
    ['08:05', `like "Let me buy 20 paper towels,"`],
    ['08:07', `or all of this toilet paper or all of these hand creams,`],
    ['08:10', `all of these bananas, just because they're on sale.`],
    ['08:13', `And yes, it might be cheaper per piece, but really think about what you're going to use`],
    ['08:18', `and what you really need because if it's food, for example,`],
    ['08:22', `I've seen people go crazy with buying a lot of food but the food will eventually expire`],
    ['08:26', `and you might not eat it all even though it was cheap.`],
    ['08:29', `I've seen my friends buy a lot of hand creams because they're all on sale`],
    ['08:33', `and then they think that they're going to keep using those hand creams forever,`],
    ['08:36', `but they just forget about them and they become storage and clutter.`],
    ['08:40', `So really think about buying what you'll really need, what you'll really use.`],
    ['08:46', `Reconsider buying too many things at once.`],
    ['08:49', `I just don't think that you always save that much money.`],
    ['08:52', `Plus, it's just always better for managing your things.`],
    ['08:57', `10) Use your public library.`],
    ['09:00', `This is something that I am looking forward to exploring more because when I was growing up,`],
    ['09:04', `my mom would take us to the library every week and we used to check out books.`],
    ['09:08', `And I really enjoyed that experience, and when I grew older,`],
    ['09:12', `I kind of forgot that that public resource was available to us.`],
    ['09:16', `I forgot that I could get a library card and check out books`],
    ['09:19', `without having to buy them on Amazon or Audible, and that can actually save a lot of money.`],
    ['09:25', `Books can get expensive, especially if you like reading.`],
    ['09:27', `So consider finding your local library.`],
    ['09:30', `See if you can get a library card because most libraries have all the books that you want to read.`],
    ['09:35', `And libraries also have DVDs, movies, audiobooks, audiotapes.`],
    ['09:40', `They got more than you think.`],
    ['09:42', `11) Plan your meals around grocery store sales.`],
    ['09:46', `This was a tip that I picked up from a friend recently, and I just never thought about it before.`],
    ['09:51', `If you look at your local grocery store, they always have certain items on sale.`],
    ['09:55', `Maybe you can find the coupons you get in the mail.`],
    ['09:58', `And plan your meals around what's on sale.`],
    ['10:01', `My friends invited us over for dinner.`],
    ['10:03', `They cooked this steak – and it was a huge steak that they got for like $6.99/lb,`],
    ['10:08', `which if you were to order that at a restaurant, it'd be like $50-60.`],
    ['10:12', `And it was because that steak was on sale and they shopped based on what was on sale.`],
    ['10:17', `And they were like, "Oh yeah, come over next time!"`],
    ['10:19', `And then we asked, "Oh, what should we cook?"`],
    ['10:20', `And they're like, "I don't know, whatever's on sale that week!"`],
    ['10:23', `So I was like, "Oh! That's actually pretty smart."`],
    ['10:26', `And I think that's a tip that you guys can start trying out and let me know how it goes.`],
    ['10:30', `12) Buy used instead of new.`],
    ['10:33', `This is a common tip, but I think there are a lot of used things that we don't typically realize is used.`],
    ['10:41', `For example: If you look on Poshmark, there's a lot of makeup palettes`],
    ['10:45', `and things like that that aren't really used –`],
    ['10:47', `they're just opened and the people don't use them –`],
    ['10:49', `so they resell them on Poshmark for a lot cheaper.`],
    ['10:53', `I personally bought a lot of things new and realized that I didn't like it or need it,`],
    ['10:57', `but I wasn't able to return it, so I just sold it on Poshmark`],
    ['11:01', `for a lot cheaper than I got it and it was better for both parties`],
    ['11:05', `because it's new but it's cheap for the customer,`],
    ['11:08', `and I didn't need it anymore and I still made some of my money back.`],
    ['11:12', `So whether you're on either ends of that spectrum,`],
    ['11:15', `you can definitely save money by buying used or selling something that you don't use anymore.`],
    ['11:21', `13) Make your own vs. buying.`],
    ['11:25', `DIY whatever you can.`],
    ['11:28', `Usually DIY does save you money.`],
    ['11:30', `In some cases, you spend more money trying to DIY things,`],
    ['11:33', `buy just to put it super simply: cooking at home,`],
    ['11:36', `making your own food vs. buying your own food.`],
    ['11:39', `Making your own clothes if you're so talented at sewing vs. buying clothes.`],
    ['11:45', `Making whatever you think you can.`],
    ['11:46', `Personally for me, I like making hand soaps, cleaner sprays, things with essential oils.`],
    ['11:52', `That's because I'm more comfortable with that realm.`],
    ['11:55', `But I've definitely made clothes for myself.`],
    ['11:57', `I've definitely made a lot of random DIYs.`],
    ['12:00', `Artwork, I've DIYed.`],
    ['12:02', `There's a lot of ways you can get creative if you're willing to put in the work yourself.`],
    ['12:07', `14) Learn to cut or do your own hair.`],
    ['12:11', `You can save a lot of money from going to the hair salon by just cutting your own hair,`],
    ['12:15', `whether it's trimming your own bangs or doing a full chop.`],
    ['12:18', `There are so many YouTube videos teaching you how to cut your hair, how to layer it evenly.`],
    ['12:23', `Or if you're not comfortable with that, you can always ask a friend to help do it for you.`],
    ['12:28', `Personally, for the past 4 or 5 years, I've dyed my own hair.`],
    ['12:32', `I would bleach it, I would tone it, put color in it.`],
    ['12:35', `So I learned all of that myself, just through looking up hair forums and YouTube tutorials.`],
    ['12:41', `This is my first year of letting someone else do my hair`],
    ['12:44', `because I'm luckily more financially abundant,`],
    ['12:47', `I can pay for someone to do my hair so I don't have to mess up my own hair.`],
    ['12:50', `But for a good amount of years, I was doing it myself and saving so much money.`],
    ['12:55', `I still tone my own hair and color my own hair too.`],
    ['12:58', `The only thing I get done is the bleach because that's tough to do yourself in the back.`],
    ['13:04', `For example: Toning my hair at home costs like $10,`],
    ['13:07', `just using the products I can buy off Amazon.`],
    ['13:10', `Toning my hair at a hair salon costs $100,`],
    ['13:14', `so you can see how much money I save just by toning my hair myself.`],
    ['13:18', `I cut my bangs myself.`],
    ['13:19', `I tone and color it.`],
    ['13:20', `I still do a lot of those things myself.`],
    ['13:22', `My last tip for today is to get social and`],
    ['13:25', `15) Swap with a friend, whether you want to swap clothing, swap books, swap –`],
    ['13:30', `I don't know – a vacuum?`],
    ['13:31', `Cleaning supplies?`],
    ['13:33', `Whatever you can swap, lend out, borrow, do that with a friend`],
    ['13:36', `so that you don't have to buy everything for yourself.`],
    ['13:39', `You can save so much money by sharing items that you don't normally use every single day.`],
    ['13:45', `That could also be a great opportunity to bond with friends`],
    ['13:47', `and get to know them on a deeper level because you're sharing the same things,`],
    ['13:51', `always calling each other up, sharing your styles.`],
    ['13:53', `It could be so much fun.`],
    ['13:55', `Alright, I hope you liked this video on 15 ways to save more money.`],
