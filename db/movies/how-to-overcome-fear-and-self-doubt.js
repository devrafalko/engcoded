    ['00:04', `Hey everyone!`],
    ['00:04', `Welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:06', `Today, let's talk about how to overcome fear and self doubt.`],
    ['00:10', `First off, fear comes in many forms.`],
    ['00:13', `Fear can come in the form of procrastination, perfectionism, resistance, insecurity.`],
    ['00:20', `And I would say that the most common fear would be the fear of failure.`],
    ['00:25', `There are so many different types of fears`],
    ['00:27', `and no matter what type of fear we're talking about,`],
    ['00:30', `ultimately, all fears are just illusions in the mind.`],
    ['00:35', `Fear only exists to you in your mind.`],
    ['00:38', `And yes, there is a purpose for fear.`],
    ['00:41', `There is a practical purpose for fear,`],
    ['00:43', `because fear is protecting you from the unknown,`],
    ['00:46', `is trying to help you not die.`],
    ['00:48', `Basically anything new, unknown, or uncomfortable is going to be scary,`],
    ['00:53', `because you don't know what's going to happen.`],
    ['00:55', `You don't know if it's going to hurt you or not,`],
    ['00:58', `and that's why you feel the fear,`],
    ['01:00', `because your fear is only trying to protect you.`],
    ['01:02', `As human beings, it's going to be normal to feel fear.`],
    ['01:06', `You can't really avoid feeling it.`],
    ['01:08', `It's going to happen for the rest of your life,`],
    ['01:10', `but you do not want to let your fear control you.`],
    ['01:14', `That is the choice that you get to make.`],
    ['01:16', `So one exercise you can do to manage`],
    ['01:18', `and overcome your fears is to start debunking your fears.`],
    ['01:23', `You know, there's that quote:`],
    ['01:24', `"There's nothing to fear but fear itself,"`],
    ['01:26', `because most of the time it's not the thing that you're afraid of.`],
    ['01:30', `It's the actual fear that's holding you back.`],
    ['01:33', `And so you shouldn't be afraid of that horrible situation that might happen.`],
    ['01:38', `You should be afraid of the fear,`],
    ['01:39', `because the fear is going to hold you back`],
    ['01:42', `more than a hypothetical situation really will.`],
    ['01:45', `So you guys might know about the Fear Setting exercise`],
    ['01:47', `that I've shared in the Artist of Life Workbook and in the Dream Life Series.`],
    ['01:51', `Well, if you don't know: Fear setting is an exercise`],
    ['01:54', `that helps you go through each one of your fears`],
    ['01:58', `and then ask yourself: "What is the worst that can happen?`],
    ['02:02', `If this fear were to come true, what's the worst case scenario?`],
    ['02:06', `And then after writing that out, ask yourself:`],
    ['02:09', `“Okay, if this worst case scenario actually happened, what would I do?`],
    ['02:14', `What could I do to bounce back from it?”`],
    ['02:17', `And so you make a plan on how you're gonna deal`],
    ['02:20', `with that worst case scenario that you're so afraid of.`],
    ['02:24', `And then at the end of the exercise, you ask yourself for each fear:`],
    ['02:27', `“If this were to happen, will I still be alive and breathing? Will I survive?”`],
    ['02:34', `So if the answer is “Yes, you're still alive`],
    ['02:37', `and you're still breathing at the end of the day,”`],
    ['02:39', `then that fear is not going to kill you, and it's okay.`],
    ['02:43', `As long as you're alive and breathing, you can still move on in life.`],
    ['02:48', `You can be resilient, you can pick yourself back up, you can try again.`],
    ['02:52', `And it really isn't the end of the world.`],
    ['02:54', `I think that's the main point of this entire exercise`],
    ['02:57', `is to realize that what you fear, even if it were to happen,`],
    ['03:00', `even if it were the worst case scenario, it's not the end of the world.`],
    ['03:05', `So if you can be aware of your fears`],
    ['03:07', `and then make a plan for how you would handle the worst case scenario,`],
    ['03:12', `then you ultimately have a plan on how you can handle anything,`],
    ['03:16', `anything that's going to go wrong.`],
    ['03:17', `And you realize that, at the end of it, you will be okay.`],
    ['03:20', `You will survive and so it is worth pursuing this thing,`],
    ['03:24', `regardless of the risks and the scary parts about it.`],
    ['03:28', `By the way, if you want to download the Fear Setting worksheets,`],
    ['03:30', `I'll have this link down below so you can click`],
    ['03:32', `and get that PDF sent to your inbox.`],
    ['03:35', `Another way you can overcome your fear and self doubt is`],
    ['03:37', `when you notice yourself thinking negative thoughts`],
    ['03:40', `and doubting yourself in the moment,`],
    ['03:43', `Ask yourself: “Are these thoughts evidence-based or am I just thinking irrationally?`],
    ['03:49', `Are there other thoughts that I can choose to think`],
    ['03:51', `rather than these negative self-doubting thoughts?”`],
    ['03:54', `Because you always have the power to choose your thoughts.`],
    ['03:57', `And when we're afraid, we're so focused on the negative,`],
    ['04:00', `we're so focused on what we don't want to happen`],
    ['04:02', `or we're focused on us not believing in ourselves,`],
    ['04:06', `and the reasons why we shouldn't believe in ourselves or whatever,`],
    ['04:09', `when in reality, there are so many other positive thoughts,`],
    ['04:13', `so many thoughts that can support you`],
    ['04:16', `and so much evidence to support the fact that you are capable`],
    ['04:20', `and you don't have to be so afraid or you don't have to doubt yourself.`],
    ['04:23', `You can really believe in yourself.`],
    ['04:25', `So it's realizing that your fear is just one thought, is just one option.`],
    ['04:30', `But there are other thoughts and other options out there for you to choose from.`],
    ['04:34', `So you really got to hone your mind and choose your thoughts,`],
    ['04:37', `like you're choosing what clothes to wear.`],
    ['04:39', `If wearing something makes you feel ugly`],
    ['04:41', `and it doesn't make you feel confident,`],
    ['04:43', `then don't wear that thought.`],
    ['04:45', `Don't wear that thing.`],
    ['04:46', `Wear something that makes you feel confident,`],
    ['04:48', `that supports you and makes you feel like you can take over the world.`],
    ['04:52', `Same thing with your thoughts.`],
    ['04:54', `Choose the thoughts that make you feel confident,`],
    ['04:56', `like you're so capable, you can take over the world.`],
    ['04:59', `The next tip is huge, and it's to realize that: Action dissolves fear.`],
    ['05:04', `I'm gonna say it again: Action dissolves fear.`],
    ['05:08', `So you want to feel the fear and do it anyway.`],
    ['05:11', `I'm sure you've heard that phrase before,`],
    ['05:13', `but it really works because when you are in action,`],
    ['05:16', `you are moving and working and doing things in the external world,`],
    ['05:21', `and it takes your mind off of what's going on in here.`],
    ['05:24', `When you're sitting there doing nothing, only thinking,`],
    ['05:27', `you allow your thoughts and your fears`],
    ['05:30', `and your overanalytical brain to run how you feel about yourself.`],
    ['05:35', `And so you let the fear be strong and powerful when you're not taking action.`],
    ['05:41', `So just think of it this way.`],
    ['05:42', `When you are not taking action, you are living more in your mind.`],
    ['05:46', `It's all in your thoughts.`],
    ['05:47', `It's all in the what if's or the fears or the insecurity, self doubt.`],
    ['05:51', `It's all really an illusion in your mind.`],
    ['05:54', `But when you're taking action, you're focused on`],
    ['05:57', `the external world rather than the internal world.`],
    ['06:01', `And so it kind of takes your mind off things`],
    ['06:03', `because you're so busy and focused on taking action.`],
    ['06:06', `So focus on taking action because action dissolves fear.`],
    ['06:10', `Lastly, I'm going to share something that I've shared before,`],
    ['06:13', `but I feel like every time I talk about fear,`],
    ['06:14', `I have to bring up this example.`],
    ['06:17', `I always love to talk about the example from Elizabeth Gilbert's Big Magic book.`],
    ['06:22', `She talks about this metaphor that helps you understand how to deal with your fear.`],
    ['06:26', `So you are on this road trip of life.`],
    ['06:29', `You are the driver.`],
    ['06:31', `You're driving along this road, you're seeing places, you're getting things done,`],
    ['06:36', `you're just living your life and driving along.`],
    ['06:38', `And fear is that baby in the back seat.`],
    ['06:41', `You have a baby that is crying and wailing`],
    ['06:43', `and being really annoying in the back seat.`],
    ['06:46', `So your fear is going to be loud.`],
    ['06:49', `It's going to bother you.`],
    ['06:51', `It might get in your head.`],
    ['06:52', `It'll just be there.`],
    ['06:53', `But you have to accept that your fear will be there with you during this ride.`],
    ['06:59', `You can't just drop the baby, throw it out of the window.`],
    ['07:01', `The baby is going with you on this road trip.`],
    ['07:04', `And even though you accept that the baby is going to be with you in this journey,`],
    ['07:10', `you do not let the baby drive because the baby is just a baby.`],
    ['07:15', `The baby doesn't really know how to drive.`],
    ['07:17', `It just knows how to cry.`],
    ['07:18', `It just knows how to be scared.`],
    ['07:20', `So you are the driver of your life.`],
    ['07:23', `You still have the choice to do what you want to do.`],
    ['07:25', `You have the ultimate say.`],
    ['07:27', `You don't have to listen to that baby in the back.`],
    ['07:30', `The baby's going to cry.`],
    ['07:31', `You just have to accept that the baby will be there with you for the ride of life.`],
    ['07:36', `So that's what fear is.`],
    ['07:37', `Fear is the baby, and you have to accept that you're always going to feel fear.`],
    ['07:41', `You're always going to have fear in your life,`],
    ['07:43', `especially when you're doing something new`],
    ['07:45', `and different outside of your comfort zone.`],
    ['07:47', `It's just natural for humans to feel fear.`],
    ['07:50', `If you didn't feel fear, you would be crazy.`],
    ['07:52', `You would just not be a regular human being.`],
    ['07:55', `So understand that fear is a normal part of our journeys.`],
    ['07:59', `But do not let fear dictate your choices.`],
    ['08:03', `Do not let fear drive.`],
    ['08:04', `Okay, I'll leave it at that for today.`],
    ['08:06', `But I also have other videos where I talk about fear or self doubt,`],
    ['08:09', `self-criticism, insecurity, all of that down below,`],
    ['08:12', `which I'll link in different playlists.`],
    ['08:14', `I highly recommend you check out the self-worth series`],
    ['08:17', `because a lot of the self doubt comes from not having enough self worth`],
    ['08:22', `and not believing in yourself enough.`],
    ['08:24', `It's so important to cultivate that self-worth, give yourself self love.`],
    ['08:29', `And all of these parts of life are interconnected`],
    ['08:32', `and you want to build a strong, solid foundation for yourself.`],
    ['08:36', `Sending you so much love for your journey and your growth.`],
    ['08:38', `And lastly, I also want to remind you that the Artist of Life Workbook,`],
    ['08:42', `the 2020 version is coming out November 1st so just get ready for that.`],
    ['08:47', `All right, see you next time.`],
    ['08:48', `Bye!`]
