    ['00:00', `There are now seven videos on the Pick Up Limes channel with the word habit in the title and we didn't just use this word`],
    ['00:05', `repeatedly by chance`],
    ['00:08', `I'm someone who really believes in the power of habit`],
    ['00:11', `And I know many of you feel the same way`],
    ['00:13', `One of my favorite quotes actually is by Aristotle when he said that we are what we repeatedly do`],
    ['00:19', `Excellence then is not an act, but a habit so today`],
    ['00:22', `That's what we're gonna delve into how to create new healthy habits, and how to break old ones`],
    ['00:30', `Cue routine reward this is the simple formula that was outlined in Charles Duhigg best-selling book the power of habit`],
    ['00:37', `Now let me break it down a little bit`],
    ['00:39', `The cue is the part that triggers the response so for example hearing your phone vibrate would be a cue the routine is the response part`],
    ['00:46', `Usually the thing we perform on autopilot in this case that would be checking our phone`],
    ['00:51', `And the reward is what gives you those feel good feelings in this case it might be`],
    ['00:56', `Distraction from work or seeing that someone commented or liked your most recent post cue routine reward pretty simple formula`],
    ['01:06', `So here's the thing if you want to establish an entirely new habit, you need to come up with a cue first`],
    ['01:11', `Otherwise you're not gonna know when to act and even when you do act it`],
    ['01:15', `Changes so much from day to day that the habits`],
    ['01:18', `Don't tend to stick so it's not enough to say I want to drink more water`],
    ['01:21', `You have to come up with a cue first which in this case could be`],
    ['01:25', `Putting a cup of water out on the desk in front of you where you're working that way every time you see it`],
    ['01:29', `It's a reminder to pick up that cup and start sipping`],
    ['01:33', `Establishing a cue is critical to creating new habits`],
    ['01:39', `Eventually the routine part is going to be performed on autopilot`],
    ['01:42', `But in the beginning you are gonna have to work for it a little bit`],
    ['01:45', `So here's a tip that might help remember that our brains are always trying to save energy`],
    ['01:50', `So if you're someone who wants to pick up the new habit of going for a run every morning`],
    ['01:53', `It can really help if the night before you set out your clothes and your shoes`],
    ['01:58', `Not only does it act as a cue when you see it`],
    ['02:00', `But it also saves you those two minutes in the morning if you're someone who also wants to decrease the amount of junk food that`],
    ['02:06', `You eat it can help then if you have other more wholesome snack choices`],
    ['02:10', `Readily on-hand like some pre-cut up fruit or some pre-made wholesome cookies`],
    ['02:15', `Decreasing the effort required to take action can really help that new habit stick`],
    ['02:22', `Before you even try setting up a new habit though, you need to know why you're doing it in other words`],
    ['02:27', `What is your why power?`],
    ['02:28', `I think a lot of the times people don't pick up new habits or change old ones because the reward just isn't satisfying enough so`],
    ['02:36', `Identify a realistic and worthy reward whether it's an endorphin rush after`],
    ['02:40', `Exercising or improved mental concentration after you've had a midday snack`],
    ['02:44', `Or a positive and happy feeling that you get after writing in your gratitude journal`],
    ['02:49', `Eventually you're gonna start to crave this reward as soon as you see the cue`],
    ['02:52', `And that's how you know the habits are starting to stick`],
    ['02:58', `So we've chatted now about creating new habits, but what about breaking the old routines that we could do without well`],
    ['03:04', `There's a well-developed strategy that might help`],
    ['03:05', `And it's really simple all you want to do is take the cue and the reward and keep those the same`],
    ['03:10', `But change the routine, so let's say for example`],
    ['03:12', `You're someone who has a little bit of a habit of reaching for candy or chocolate after lunch every single day`],
    ['03:17', `And you want to break that habit the cue in this case is that mid-afternoon hunger`],
    ['03:22', `and the reward might be both the sweet taste as well as`],
    ['03:25', `Kind of that midday energy boost you get from it so all you want to do is change the routine so instead of reaching for`],
    ['03:31', `Chocolate you might instead reach for some apple slices that you've dipped into nut butter. It's sweet`],
    ['03:36', `It's filling and it's rewarding, so you don't want to resist the craving you just want to redirect it`],
    ['03:41', `And sure it's not gonna be an easy substitute at first`],
    ['03:44', `but with repetition it will become a habit and a snack choice that you do start to crave`],
    ['03:52', `The last of Charles Duhigg points that I really want to mention in this video are what he calls Keystone habits`],
    ['03:57', `These are the habits that if adopted or changed kind of create a domino effect in other areas of our lives`],
    ['04:03', `For example for some people the habit of waking up early can have other positive effects on other habits`],
    ['04:09', `It can mean enjoying breakfast which might then mean that they're gonna have a lesser tendency to reach for unhealthy`],
    ['04:15', `convenient foods later in the day it might also give them the time to`],
    ['04:18', `Work on their most important tasks before noon which then increases their productivity and feeling of accomplishment`],
    ['04:25', `Other Keystone habits might be things like exercising or writing in a gratitude journal`],
    ['04:29', `You can see then how these Keystone habits go on to influence a wider sphere of habits it allows for small wins`],
    ['04:35', `That gives us more courage and motivation to pick up other healthy habits as well`],
    ['04:40', `Now the tips I've shared with you in this video`],
    ['04:41', `Just scratch the surface when it comes to all of the amazing tips that can be found in the book the power of habit`],
    ['04:46', `By Charles Duhigg. It's a book`],
    ['04:48', `I listened to three years ago, and I am still reaping the benefits of it today`],
    ['04:52', `So I highly recommend it as usual the amazing folks over at audible have gone ahead and partnered with us on this video`],
    ['04:58', `Which means that we can offer you the book or any other book of your choosing as well as a 30-day membership`],
    ['05:03', `free of charge if you visit the link in the description box below or visit audible.com/pickuplines`],
    ['05:10', `For now I just want to emphasize`],
    ['05:11', `Focus on changing only one habit at a time`],
    ['05:14', `And if you need it to have a bit more of an impact on your life`],
    ['05:16', `You can target those Keystone habits take out a pen and paper and write down what you think the cue`],
    ['05:22', `Routine and reward loop are for the given habit because if you can identify those. It's more likely that it's gonna stick now`],
    ['05:28', `Now I'm curious to know what is this habit that you're looking to add or to change?`],
    ['05:32', `Let me know by sharing in the comments below if you enjoyed this video it always shows a lot of love and support if you`],
