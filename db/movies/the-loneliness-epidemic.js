    ['00:52', `to discover both how we've gotten to this place and more importantly`],
    ['00:55', `how do we as individuals in a society start to turn the tide?`],
    ['00:59', `This is my 20-minute interview with Johann about what he learned from that research.`],
    ['01:04', `All right, so why don't we start out with a little bit of a intro about yourself and about your work.`],
    ['01:10', `I really- I write my book "Lost Connections" because there were the- these two mysteries that were really hanging over me for years`],
    ['01:16', `Look, I was quite afraid to look into them in some ways`],
    ['01:19', `The first mystery is I'm 40 years old and every year that I've been alive`],
    ['01:25', `Depression and anxiety have increased here in the United States, in Britain, and across the Western world`],
    ['01:31', `Right and I kept asking myself`],
    ['01:34', `Why?`],
    ['01:35', `Why is this happening? Why are so many more of us each year that passes finding it hard to get through the day right and`],
    ['01:42', `I guess I wanted to understand that from because I'm a more personal mystery`],

    ['01:49', `Remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling like a pain was leaking out of me out`],

    ['01:58', `Very ashamed of it`],
    ['02:00', `I felt`],
    ['02:01', `Confused by it`],
    ['02:02', `I didn't understand why it was happening`],
    ['02:04', `And my doctor told me a story that, and now realized were speaking to the leading scientists in the world on this was oversimplified`],
    ['02:10', `Right. My doctor said we know why people feel like this. It's just cuz of a problem in your brain`],
    ['02:15', `There's a chemical called serotonin that makes people feel good`],
    ['02:19', `Some people are naturally lacking it. You're clearly one of them. All we need to do is give you some drugs`],
    ['02:23', `You're gonna feel better`],
    ['02:24', `so I started taking a chemical anti-depressant called Paxil and I felt significantly better for a few months and`],
    ['02:29', `Then this feeling of pain came back. So I'm back doctor said wanna get high enough dose. I was gonna hide dose again`],
    ['02:35', `I felt better again. The feeling of pain came back and I was really in this cycle of taking higher and higher doses`],
    ['02:41', `until for thirteen years`],
    ['02:42', `I was taking the maximum dose you're allowed to take at the end of which I was still really depressed`],
    ['02:46', `And I was surrounded by people who are becoming more and more depressed`],
    ['02:49', `So I just forced myself really to start looking into this. So I ended up going on this big journey for the book`],
    ['02:56', `I travelled over 40,000 miles`],
    ['02:58', `I wanted to meet the leading experts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety`],
    ['03:02', `And what solves them most importantly so I'm at you know`],
    ['03:05', `Not just leading experts, but just a crazy mixture of people with different perspectives from an Amish village in Indiana`],
    ['03:10', `Cuz the Amish have very low levels of depression to a city in Brazil that banned`],
    ['03:15', `Advertising to see if that would make people feel better to a lab in Baltimore than where they were giving people`],
    ['03:20', `Psychedelics to see if that would help and I learned a huge number of things but the core of what I learned`],
    ['03:26', `Is that there's scientific evidence for nine different causes of depression and anxiety`],
    ['03:31', `Two of them are in fact biological. My doctor wasn't wrong and`],
    ['03:35', `Your genes can make you more vulnerable to these problems`],
    ['03:37', `just like some people find it easier to put on weight than others and`],
    ['03:40', `There are real changes in your brain that begin when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out`],
    ['03:46', `but most of the factors that cause depression or anxiety are not in our biology. Most of the factors for which there's scientific evidence are`],
    ['03:54', `Factors in the way we're living and what I learned in the process of writing the book and speaking to so many`],
    ['04:00', `Scientists is once you understand the causes of depression or anxiety in this more complex way`],
    ['04:06', `Opens up a much broader range of possible solutions that I saw being pinned`],
    ['04:12', `Just all over the world`],
    ['04:13', `And these are solutions that we need to be explaining to people and offering to them alongside not instead of but as an option alongside`],
    ['04:21', `Chemical antidepressants why is society at large?`],
    ['04:25', `Reacting in this way. What do you think are some of the influences on people's well-being?`],
    ['04:29', `That's leading to the higher and higher rates and depression and anxiety`],
    ['04:33', `I'll give you an example of one of the nine causes that arrived at in lost connections. We are below Lea's society`],
    ['04:39', `There's ever been there's a study that asks Americans`],
    ['04:42', `how many close friends do you have you could turn to in a crisis and`],
    ['04:46', `When they started doing this years ago`],
    ['04:47', `The most common answer was five today the most common answer not the average but the most common answer is none half of all Americans`],
    ['04:56', `Asked how many people know you well say`],
    ['04:59', `Nobody right? I spent a lot of time talking to an amazing man called professor`],
    ['05:03', `John Cacioppo is that it was the leading expert in the world on loneliness. He was at the University of Chicago`],
    ['05:09', `And he explained to me`],
    ['05:10', `Why are we alive you and me and everyone watching this? Why do we exist?`],
    ['05:15', `One key reason is that our ancestors on the savannah's of Africa were really good at one thing`],
    ['05:21', `They weren't bigger than the animals they took down. They weren't faster than the animals they took down`],
    ['05:26', `But they were much better at banding together into groups and cooperating just like bees evolved to live in a hive`],
    ['05:33', `Humans evolved to live in a tribe and if you think about the circumstances where we evolved if you were cut off from the tribe`],
    ['05:38', `You were depressed and anxious for really good reasons. You weren't terrible danger you were about to die`],
    ['05:43', `Those are still the impulses we have we are the first humans ever`],
    ['05:48', `In the long 2 million year history of our species to try to disband our tribes and is making us feel awful`],
    ['05:55', `So a key thing for me was not just to understand these problems. But ok. How do we solve those problems?`],
    ['06:02', `Right and one of the heroes of my book Lost Connections is an amazing man called. Dr`],
    ['06:07', `Sam ever Hampton who pioneered a whole different approach based on this understanding`],
    ['06:11', `so Sam was a general practitioner in East London poor part of East London where I live for a long time and`],
    ['06:17', `Sam was really uncomfortable because he had loads of patients coming to him with terrible depression and anxiety`],
    ['06:22', `And like me he thinks there's some role for chemical antidepressants`],
    ['06:27', `But he could also see most of the people he was giving them to did become depressed again`],
    ['06:30', `And he could see that they were depressed and anxious for perfectly understandable reasons`],
    ['06:34', `Right like to give one of the examples I took about in the book loneliness`],
    ['06:38', `So he decided to pioneer a different approach one day a woman came to see him called Lisa Cunningham`],
    ['06:43', `He'd been shut away in our home with dreadful depression and anxiety for seven years and Sam said to Lisa. Don't worry`],
    ['06:50', `I'll carry on giving you these drugs. I'm also gonna suggest something else. There was an area behind the doctors the suite of doctors offices`],
    ['06:59', `There was no known as dog share alley which gives you sense of what it was like just kind of scrubland`],
    ['07:05', `Sam said to Lisa what I'd like you to come and do is turn out a few times a week`],
    ['07:09', `I'm gonna come to you cuz I've been pretty anxious`],
    ['07:12', `We're gonna meet with a group of other depressed and anxious people. And we're gonna`],
    ['07:16', `find something to do together as a group, right the first time the group met Lisa was literally physically sick with anxiety`],
    ['07:23', `But the group starts talking they're like, what can we do?`],
    ['07:26', `These are inner-city East London people`],
    ['07:28', `They don't know anything about gardening they decided they're going to teach themselves gardening right gonna turn dogshit alley into a beautiful garden`],
    ['07:34', `So they started watching YouTube. They start to read books`],
    ['07:37', `They start to get their fingers in the soil. They start to learn the rhythms of the seasons`],
    ['07:42', `There's a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful`],
    ['07:46', `Antidepressant start to do something even more important. They started to form a tribe`],
    ['07:51', `they started to form a group they started to care about each other and you know, if`],
    ['07:56', `If one person didn't turn up, they'd go and look for them. They'd see if they were okay`],
    ['08:00', `They did what human beings do when they're part of tribes. They started to solve each other's problems`],
    ['08:05', `The way Lisa put it to me as the garden began to bloom. We began to bloom`],
    ['08:11', `There was a study in Norway of a very similar program found. It was more than twice as effective as chemical antidepressants. I`],
    ['08:18', `Think for an obvious reason, right?`],
    ['08:19', `It was dealing with some of the reasons why they felt so bad in the first place and this is something I saw all over`],
    ['08:25', `The world from Sydney to São Paulo to San Francisco the most effective strategies for dealing with depression and anxiety`],
    ['08:32', `Are the ones that deal with the reasons why we're in such distress in the first place?`],
    ['08:36', `You said that we're living in the loneliest society. There's ever been`],
    ['08:41', `how`],
    ['08:44', `Can that possibly be with all of these tools at our fingertips, right we have social media`],
    ['08:49', `We have the ability to connect and interact with anybody in an instant`],
    ['08:52', `I can FaceTime my mom in a second. And if she picks up then we can I can see her face to face`],
    ['09:00', `has social media`],
    ['09:03', `Played some part in the fact that we are lonely`],
    ['09:06', `This is a complex question and with a complex answer`],
    ['09:09', `So the glib answer is to go, yeah social media did this to us. Is this too simplistic?`],
    ['09:13', `To understand this I went to the first-ever internet rehab center in the world. It's in just outside Spokane in Washington State`],
    ['09:20', `It's called restart, Washington. I remember I've arrived there. It's a clearing in the woods`],
    ['09:25', `I get out. I got out the car and absolutely instinctively`],
    ['09:29', `I looked at my phone to check my email and felt really pissed off. I couldn't see it go. There was no reception`],
    ['09:33', `I was like, oh wait you came to the right place?`],
    ['09:35', `Right and I spent a fair bit of time there and it's totally fascinating`],
    ['09:39', `They get a whole range of people at restart Washington, but they disproportionately get`],
    ['09:44', `Young men who become obsessed with these multiplayer role-playing games like World of Warcraft or not at the time that I was there`],
    ['09:50', `but now fortnight right and`],
    ['09:52', `I'm about Dr. Hillary cash the amazing woman who runs this Center`],
    ['09:57', `Sent me that you've got to ask yourself`],
    ['09:59', `What are these young men getting out of these games? Because they're getting something right? I`],
    ['10:04', `think what they're getting`],
    ['10:08', `is a`],
    ['10:09', `Kind of hollow version of the things they used to get from the society`],
    ['10:13', `But they no longer get they get a sense of a tribe they get a sense of status and they can gain in status`],
    ['10:19', `They get a sense. They're good at something they get a sense. They're moving around`],
    ['10:23', `Young people barely leave their homes. Now. It's incredible the figures for how rarely children play outdoors`],
    ['10:29', `but what they're getting is, I started to think that the relationship between say these these games or`],
    ['10:36', `For media and social life is like the relationship between porn and sex, right?`],
    ['10:40', `I'm not against porn don't meet a certain basic edge`],
    ['10:43', `But if your entire sex life consisted of looking at porn you'd be going around pissed off and irritated the whole time`],
    ['10:49', `Because we didn't evolve to masturbate over screens`],
    ['10:51', `We evolved to have sex right that wouldn't meet your deeper needs in the same way`],
    ['10:56', `I'm not obviously not against the internet would be ridiculous, right?`],
    ['11:01', `But we didn't evolve to talk through screens, right`],
    ['11:05', `We didn't evolve to look at each other and interact through with our friends through screens`],
    ['11:09', `If you and I was speaking even via Skype now`],
    ['11:12', `I wouldn't feel you were seeing me and you wouldn't feel you was the other way around`],
    ['11:18', `In the way that we feel that we are seeing and hearing each other now, right?`],
    ['11:23', `human beings have a need to be seen and`],
    ['11:26', `The leading expert on loneliness in the world professor John Cacioppo said gave me good little rule of thumb. He said`],
    ['11:33', `If social media is a way station for meeting people offline or staying in touch with them that you'll see offline`],
    ['11:38', `It's a good thing if it's the last stop on the line generally something's gone wrong`],
    ['11:43', `But he's I think we have to think about as well`],
    ['11:47', `the moment in human history when social media arrives`],
    ['11:50', `Right a lot of the causes of depression and anxiety that I write about in my book loss connections`],
    ['11:56', `Were already supercharged by then by the late 90s the early 2000s loneliness have gone up`],
    ['12:02', `Values have gone up a whole range of things`],
    ['12:04', `And what happens is the internet arrives and it looks a lot like the things we've lost`],
    ['12:12', `You've lost friends. Here's a load of Facebook friends. You've lost status`],
    ['12:17', `Make some status updates, right but it's not the thing. We've lost. It's a kind of`],
    ['12:22', `Parody of the thing we've lost and what we need to do in very practical ways is restore`],
    ['12:28', `The thing we've lost it seems like today. We have a lot of distractions`],
    ['12:33', `That could potentially pull us away from that connection`],
    ['12:38', `It seems like a lot of people are driven through consumerism and materialism`],
    ['12:43', `and`],
    ['12:44', `Many of us are safer and have more than ever have before the size of homes has increased steadily`],
    ['12:51', `since the`],
    ['12:53', `1930s and 40s`],
    ['12:55', `is there any correlation between`],
    ['12:57', `material wealth and`],
    ['13:00', `Happiness, one of the things I found most challenging in the research for the book because I could see how much it played out in`],
    ['13:06', `my own life`],
    ['13:08', `Was some research by an amazing man called Professor Tim Casa`],
    ['13:11', `So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick right as I can tell from my chins`],
    ['13:16', `I'm not immune to this myself`],
    ['13:19', `But it's equally strong evidence that a kind of junk of values have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick`],
    ['13:26', `Professor Kass showed. So for thousands of years`],
    ['13:30', `Philosophers have said, you know if you think a life is about money and status and shoving off. You're gonna feel like shit, right?`],
    ['13:38', `It's not an exact quote from Confucius. But that is the gist of what he said, right?`],
    ['13:41', `But no one scientifically investigated this until professor Kassar`],
    ['13:46', `And he showed a few I think really important things`],
    ['13:49', `Firstly he showed the more you think life is about money and status and shoving off`],
    ['13:55', `The more likely you are to become depressed and anxious by a really quite significant amount`],
    ['13:59', `I think this is because we're going a little bit beyond professor kasih here, but I think this is because`],
    ['14:05', `Everyone knows they have natural physical needs right? You need food. You need water. You need shelter. You need clean air`],
    ['14:12', `If I took those things away from you. You'll been real trouble real fast, and there is equally strong evidence that all human beings have natural psychological means`],
    ['14:20', `You need to feel you belong you need to feel your life has meaning and purpose. You need to feel that people`],
    ['14:25', `See you and value you beautifully. You've got a future that makes sense and our culture is good at lots of things`],
    ['14:31', `I'm glad to be alive today`],
    ['14:33', `but we've been getting less and less good and meeting these deep underlying psychological needs if you think`],
    ['14:38', `partly because there's many factors going on but partly because if you think life is about money and and`],
    ['14:43', `Displaying that money that's gonna divert you from the things you actually do need to have a a meaningful and satisfying life`],
    ['14:51', `But professor Cass also said something else. So you showed the more you follow these junk values`],
    ['14:57', `The more likely while to become depressed and anxious`],
    ['15:00', `He also showed as a society as a culture. We have become much more driven by these junk bodies`],
    ['15:07', `It's a cliche to say to your viewers`],
    ['15:10', `You won't lie on your deathbed and think about what the likes you've got on Instagram and all the shoes you bought right?`],
    ['15:16', `You'll think about moments of love and meaning and connection in your lives. But as Professor Casa puts it we live in a machine`],
    ['15:22', `That's designed to get us to neglect`],
    ['15:23', `What is important about life right more eighteen-month-old children know what the McDonald's M means the know their own last name?`],
    ['15:29', `we're immersed in a machinery that tells us how to do this professor Gossard had really interesting research about how we`],
    ['15:37', `How we undo some of that and some of it was really simple`],
    ['15:40', `he got a group of people to me once every couple of weeks for four months and just talk about`],
    ['15:47', `firstly`],
    ['15:48', `consumer objects, they thought they had to have`],
    ['15:50', `things like Nike sneakers`],
    ['15:53', `Once they talked out loud`],
    ['15:54', `how do you think your life will be different when you've got them didn't take long for people to start seeing maybe this is`],
    ['16:00', `Bullshit that's been implanted in my head by advertising but then there were important bit was they've got people to talk about well`],
    ['16:06', `What are moments`],
    ['16:07', `That's not a moment that's gonna make you feel satisfied`],
    ['16:10', `What are moment's you have actually felt your life was meaningful satisfying, but we'll talk about different things to some people`],
    ['16:16', `It was playing music some people it was swimming some people it was writing whatever it was and and they started saying well`],
    ['16:22', `How could you build more of that into your life seeking more of that and doing more of that and less of?`],
    ['16:28', `seeking this kind of junk value stuff and`],
    ['16:31', `Just that process of meeting every couple of weeks and checking in with each other and explaining how they try to do it`],
    ['16:36', `Led to a measurable. They did a good scientific study at this`],
    ['16:40', `Immeasurable shift in people's values to become less materialistic, which we know relates to less depression and anxiety. Now of course is the case that`],
    ['16:48', `And a guy professor richard Laird has done research on this if you don't have a baseline of material goods`],
    ['16:53', `right`],
    ['16:54', `If you are in poverty that makes you then you are going to be unhappy`],
    ['16:57', `But once you've actually reached a fairly low level of income that you're not actually wanting the basic things`],
    ['17:03', `additional money makes, you know happier and actually`],
    ['17:07', `Constantly seeking it leads to a corruption of values that makes significantly more unhappy`],
    ['17:11', `We talked a little bit before we sat down here about Marie Kondo and minimalism and this movement of people rejecting`],
    ['17:19', `consumerism and materialism`],
    ['17:21', `to live with less stuff to purchase less things to`],
