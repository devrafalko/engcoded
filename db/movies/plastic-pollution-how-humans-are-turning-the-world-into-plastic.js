    ['00:00', `When the gods granted king Midas one wish, he wished that everything he touched would turn to gold.`],
    ['00:07', `Midas was delighted. Trees, rocks, buildings all gold.`],
    ['00:12', `But soon he found in horror that his food turned into gold as well.`],
    ['00:17', `When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain, he realized his mistake too late.`],
    ['00:23', `The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken and alone.`],
    ['00:29', `Humanity got a similar wish granted when we learned how to turn brown stinky goo into magic - plastic.`],
    ['00:36', `Cheap, sterile and convenient it changed our lives`],
    ['00:41', `But this wonder of technology got a little out of hand.`],
    ['00:46', `Plastic has saturated our environment.`],
    ['00:48', `It has invaded the animals we eat and now it's finding its way into our bodies.`],
    ['00:55', `[Catchy intro music]`],
    ['01:05', `What is plastic?`],
    ['01:07', `For most of our history humans used stuff we found in nature to build the things we needed.`],
    ['01:12', `But the invention of plastic roughly 100 years ago completely changed our world.`],
    ['01:17', `Plastic is made from polymers - long repeating chains of molecule groups.`],
    ['01:22', `In nature, polymers exist everywhere : the walls of cells, silk, hair, insect carapaces, DNA.`],
    ['01:31', `But it's also possible to create them.`],
    ['01:35', `By breaking down crude oil into its components and Rearranging them, we can form new synthetic polymers.`],
    ['01:42', `Synthetic polymers have extraordinary traits.`],
    ['01:45', `They are lightweight, durable and can be molded into almost any shape.`],
    ['01:50', `Not requiring time-consuming manual work, plastic can be easily mass-produced`],
    ['01:55', `and its raw materials are a vailable in vast amounts`],
    ['01:58', `And incredibly cheaply, and so the golden era of plastics began`],
    ['02:04', `Bakelite was used for mechanical parts, PVC for plumbing electric gears and cases,`],
    ['02:11', `Acrylic is a shatter resistant alternative to glass and nylon for stockings and war equipment`],
    ['02:17', `Today almost everything is at least partly made from plastic.`],
    ['02:20', `Our clothes, phones, computers, furniture, appliances, houses and cars.`],
    ['02:26', `Plastic has long ceased to be a revolutionary material instead it became trash.`],
    ['02:31', `Coffee cups, plastic bags, or stuff to wrap a banana. We don't think about this fact a lot.`],
    ['02:37', `Plastic just appears and goes away.`],
    ['02:40', `Unfortunately, it doesn't`],
    ['02:43', `Since synthetic polymers are so durable, plastic takes between 500 and 1,000 years to break down.`],
    ['02:50', `But somehow we collectively decided to use this super tough material for things meant to be thrown away.`],
    ['02:57', `40% of plastics are used for packaging.`],
    ['03:01', `In the United States, packaging makes up 1/3 of all the waste that is generated annually.`],
    ['03:07', `Since its invention, we have produced about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic.`],
    ['03:14', `335 million tons in 2016 alone.`],
    ['03:18', `More than 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic have become waste since 1907.`],
    ['03:24', `Piled up in one place, that makes a cube with a side length of 1.9 kilometers.`],
    ['03:30', `So what did we do with all this waste?`],
    ['03:33', `9% was recycled, 12% burnt.`],
    ['03:37', `But`],
    ['03:38', `79% of it is sticking around still.`],
    ['03:42', `A lot ends up in the ocean. Around 8 million tons a year.`],
    ['03:47', `That's so much plastic that it will outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050.`],
    ['03:53', `Because it's everywhere, marine animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it.`],
    ['03:59', `In 2015 already 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic.`],
    ['04:03', `Many animals starve with stomachs full of indigestible trash. In 2018 a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain.`],
    ['04:11', `He had eaten 32 kilos of plastic bags, nets and a drum`],
    ['04:16', `While this is tragic and makes for great magazine covers, there's an even more widespread,`],
    ['04:22', `invisible form of plastic.`],
    ['04:25', `Microplastics`],
    ['04:27', `Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 millimeters`],
    ['04:31', `Some of them are used in cosmetics or toothpaste,`],
    ['04:34', `but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation`],
    ['04:40', `And crumbles into smaller and smaller pieces`],
    ['04:43', `51 trillion such particles float in the ocean,`],
    ['04:46', `Where they are even more easily swallowed by all kinds of marine life.`],
    ['04:50', `This has raised concerns among scientists,`],
    ['04:53', `especially about health risks from the chemicals that are added to plastic.`],
    ['04:57', `BPA for example makes plastic bottles transparent`],
    ['05:00', `But there's also evidence that it interferes with our hormonal system. DEHP makes plastics more flexible,`],
    ['05:07', `But may cause cancer.`],
    ['05:09', `It would be pretty bad if micro plastics are toxic, because they travel up the food chain.`],
    ['05:15', `Zooplankton eat micro plastic. Small fish eat zooplankton.`],
    ['05:20', `So do oysters, crabs and predatory fish and they all land on our plate.`],
    ['05:26', `Micro plastics have been found in honey, in sea salt, in beer, in tap water and in the household dust around us.`],
    ['05:34', `8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults`],
    ['05:38', `have measurable amounts of phthalates, a common plastic additive in their bodies.`],
    ['05:43', `And 93% of people have BPA in their urine`],
    ['05:46', `There is little science about this so far and right now it's inconclusive.`],
    ['05:51', `We need a lot more research before panic is justified.`],
    ['05:54', `But it is safe to say that a lot of stuff happened that we didn't plan for. And we have lost control`],
    ['06:00', `Over plastic to a certain extent which is kind of scary.`],
    ['06:04', `But just to make sure we should simply ban plastics, right?`],
    ['06:08', `Unfortunately, it's a bit more complicated than that.`],
    ['06:12', `Plastic pollution is not the only environmental challenge we face.`],
    ['06:16', `Some of the substitutes we'd use for plastic have a higher environmental impact in other ways.`],
    ['06:22', `For example :`],
    ['06:23', `according to a recent study by the Danish government,`],
    ['06:25', `making a single-use plastic bag requires so little energy and produces far lower carbon dioxide emissions`],
    ['06:32', `compared to a reusable cotton bag, that you need to use your cotton bag 7 thousand 100 times`],
    ['06:38', `before it would have a lower impact on the environment than the plastic bag.`],
    ['06:43', `We're left with a complex process of trade-offs. Everything has an impact somehow,`],
    ['06:48', `and it's hard to find the right balance between them.`],
    ['06:51', `Plastic also helps solve problems that we don't have very good answers for at the moment.`],
    ['06:56', `Globally, one-third of all food that's produced is never eaten and ends up rotting away on landfills where it produces methane.`],
    ['07:03', `And the best way of preventing food from spoiling and avoiding unnecessary waste is still plastic packaging.`],
    ['07:10', `It's also important to note where the vast majority of the world's plastic pollution is coming from right now.`],
    ['07:16', `90% of all plastic waste entering the ocean through rivers comes from just ten rivers in Asia and Africa.`],
    ['07:22', `The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5 million tons of plastic into the ocean each year.`],
    ['07:28', `Countries like China, India`],
    ['07:31', `Algeria or Indonesia`],
    ['07:33', `industrialized at an impressive pace in the last few decades,`],
    ['07:36', `transforming the lives of billions of people`],
    ['07:39', `This development was so fast,`],
    ['07:41', `that the garbage disposal infrastructure couldn't keep up with collecting and recycling all the new waste this brought`],
    ['07:47', `If politicians in Europe and the US want to address this issue,`],
    ['07:50', `investing in infrastructure in developing countries is just as important`],
    ['07:54', `as fighting plastic pollution at home with campaigns and redesigning products to minimize unnecessary`],
    ['08:00', `plastic production.`],
    ['08:01', `The bottom line is, as long as we don't address plastic pollution from a global perspective, we will not solve it.`],
    ['08:09', `Plastic pollution is a complicated problem.`],
    ['08:12', `We found a magic material and we had a really good time with it,`],
    ['08:16', `But we need to be careful or just like Midas, we'll end up in a world that we didn't wish for.`],
    ['08:24', `Your individual daily actions still have a huge impact. What you do matters!`],
    ['08:31', `Refuse disposable plastics. Convince your friends and family to do the same.`],
    ['08:36', `Pressure companies and politicians to take the necessary steps to keep our oceans clean and our food safe.`],
    ['08:43', `Together we can beat plastic pollution!`],
    ['08:46', `This video was a collaboration with UN Environment and their clean seas campaign.`],
    ['08:52', `If you want to take action to turn the tide on plastics, go to cleanseas.org and make your pledge.`]
