    ['00:00', `Since day one I was a very active, let's say spirited child.`],
    ['00:04', `I sound like a condescending parent.`],
    ['00:16', `As an adult this is translated into a fierce drive`],
    ['00:20', `to create, and do, and put myself out there.`],
    ['00:23', `I take a lot of pride in saying that I have my mother's work ethic.`],
    ['00:26', `And that I'm willing to push harder and for longer than others around me.`],
    ['00:31', `That being said, lately I've been feeling way off.`],
    ['00:34', `I've been feeling creatively and mentally bogged down,`],
    ['00:39', `like I'm trying to run through mud.`],
    ['00:41', `I've been exploring digital minimalism quite a bit lately.`],
    ['00:43', `Creating limits and finding ways to curb social media and internet usage,`],
    ['00:48', `but I think this goes way deeper than that.`],
    ['00:50', `I think this is a consequence of an addiction that I have to productivity,`],
    ['00:55', `and never taking breaks.`],
    ['00:57', `We live in a world that really encourages this.`],
    ['01:00', `You know, when are we supposed to slow down and not be`],
    ['01:04', `productivity machines every once in a while.`],
    ['01:06', `Work is like the first thing that I think of when I wake up every day,`],
    ['01:10', `and it's probably the very last thing that I'm contemplating before I go to bed as well.`],
    ['01:15', `The problem I have is that I love what I do and`],
    ['01:18', `creating these videos adds a depth and sense of`],
    ['01:23', `meaning to my life that absolutely nothing else does.`],
    ['01:26', `But well-being requires`],
    ['01:28', `balance, you know and that's something that I seriously lack.`],
    ['01:31', `Recently, I got a few comments and messages on doing what is known as a 24 hour dopamine fast.`],
    ['01:38', `This is kind of like doing a 1-day homemade version of a vipassana retrat.`],
    ['01:43', `It's kind of crazy, but it intrigued me as a way to sort of break this cycle that I'm in.`],
    ['01:48', `Basically, you go an entire day without using the internet,`],
    ['01:51', `or any technology like your phone, or computer,`],
    ['01:55', `doing any work, exercise, sexual activity, reading, or listening to music.`],
    ['02:00', `I decided to make this a water fast as well,`],
    ['02:03', `which meant nothing but water for 24 hours.`],
    ['02:06', `So I decided to try it out because why not?`],
    ['02:09', `I feel like my whole life is a series of experiments.`],
    ['02:12', `My only exceptions would be to use my GoPro`],
    ['02:15', `as a way to sort of document thoughts in the whole process,`],
    ['02:18', `and my phone as a timer for when I do meditation.`],
    ['02:23', `All right.`],
    ['02:26', `It is 9:27 a.m.`],
    ['02:28', `I just slept for nearly 10 hours.`],
    ['02:31', `That is insane.`],
    ['02:33', `I can't even remember the last time I slept that long.`],
    ['02:36', `That is a long time. This is a bit of a strange sensation.`],
    ['02:40', `I'm pretty sure I have never done anything even similar to this in my entire life.`],
    ['02:44', `I've never had nothing to do all day long.`],
    ['02:49', `Like I said before I've always had a`],
    ['02:52', `strong drive to do things`],
    ['02:54', `and oftentimes that's just because I love learning and I love creating,`],
    ['02:59', `but sometimes I think it's also because of a fear that I have`],
    ['03:03', `of time slipping by and not doing enough.`],
    ['03:06', `I can already feel my thoughts racing`],
    ['03:09', `even though`],
    ['03:10', `there's nothing going on.`],
    ['03:12', `I'm very familiar with this feeling of pressure,`],
    ['03:15', `of having to start the day and get going.`],
    ['03:17', `And I even felt it today`],
    ['03:19', `even though I have absolutely nothing to do, which is very interesting,`],
    ['03:23', `how our patterns get set within us.`],
    ['03:26', `So my plan really is to, I guess, do a lot of meditation.`],
    ['03:30', `I'm gonna be documenting it.`],
    ['03:32', `But other than that,`],
    ['03:34', `I have no idea what I'm gonna do.`],
    ['03:37', `I refuse to look back on my life in old age and regret missed opportunities,`],
    ['03:41', `or you know a life governed by fear and doubt.`],
    ['03:46', `That's just not gonna happen.`],
    ['03:47', `However, the rhythm I'm currently living at`],
    ['03:50', `is unsustainable and I feel like`],
    ['03:54', `work can be as much of an escape as anything else.`],
    ['03:57', `You know, like alcohol, or gambling, or whatever.`],
    ['04:00', `It's an amazing way to distract yourself from other things that are going on`],
    ['04:04', `and I think that that is what people like Elon Musk do.`],
    ['04:08', `That's the only way that I can think of`],
    ['04:10', `for somebody to handle the amount of pressure that he's under.`],
    ['04:21', `Basically, with your car, with your computer,`],
    ['04:24', `with basically anything that you own`],
    ['04:26', `there's some sort of maintenance process.`],
    ['04:29', `You gotta take it in to get it checked, or get something fixed,`],
    ['04:33', `or repairs or whatever.`],
    ['04:34', `The thing is, I don't think we do that with ourselves anymore.`],
    ['04:40', `Because of the constant exposure to stimulus, and our phones, and technology, and the Internet,`],
    ['04:46', `it just never stops.`],
    ['04:48', `So I think that's kind of what this is for me today, you know.`],
    ['04:51', `It's like a maintenance day and it's not so much for my body,`],
    ['04:55', `it's for my mind. I feel like my mind is what needs it.`],
    ['04:58', `Because I'll give my body rest days. There's days when I don't work out or whatever,`],
    ['05:03', `but I just can't even remember the last time I've given my mind`],
    ['05:08', `a day to rest, to reset completely.`],
    ['05:11', `So I guess we are have to just see what happens.`],
    ['05:14', `So this was a personal challenge, more than anything,`],
    ['05:17', `to not let absolutely anything distract me,`],
    ['05:20', `or allow me to run from myself.`],
    ['05:23', `So there are a couple of other things that I am`],
    ['05:26', `wanting to face today as well.`],
    ['05:29', `The first is a fear of boredom.`],
    ['05:31', `I think this is something that`],
    ['05:33', `my generation really struggles with, in particular,`],
    ['05:37', `but I think we all struggle with this nowadays.`],
    ['05:40', `I see old people glued to technology as well, so I don't think any of us are exempt at this point.`],
    ['05:44', `And also this feeling of not getting enough done in a day.`],
    ['05:49', `You know, if I don't have a particularly productive`],
    ['05:52', `day where I'm focused on my work, and getting things done, and finishing projects, and whatnot,`],
    ['05:58', `I have this horrible feeling of`],
    ['06:01', `not having done enough.`],
    ['06:03', `You know, kind of like the day slipped through my fingers,`],
    ['06:06', `and I'm wondering if my priorities are`],
    ['06:10', `maybe not in the right place, you know.`],
    ['06:13', `Because it really affects me.`],
    ['06:15', `It has a very powerful negative effect on me that I don't like.`],
    ['06:21', `I want to be able to have off days,`],
    ['06:24', `I want to be able to not be operating at my best at all times, you know.`],
    ['06:30', `Basically, I want the freedom to be a human being.`],
    ['06:32', `I've always struggled with ending the day,`],
    ['06:35', `and arriving to the time when it's appropriate to go to bed.`],
    ['06:39', `But, not feeling like I've done enough and that horrible sinking feeling,`],
    ['06:44', `kind of like I'm trying to stay ahead of something,`],
    ['06:47', `you know, some sort of disaster or some sort of`],
    ['06:51', `destruction of some kind if I were to fall behind, you know, if I weren't to keep up my pace.`],
    ['06:57', `I don't know if that makes any sense, but that's kind of how I feel.`],
    ['07:00', `I'm not going to be an invincible 21-year-old forever.`],
    ['07:04', `Time will eventually get me,`],
    ['07:06', `and if my sense of self-worth is entirely dependent on what I'm capable of doing right now`],
    ['07:13', `I think I'm going to have to face some harsh realities eventually.`],
    ['07:18', `I'm gonna journal a little bit,`],
    ['07:20', `and then I'm gonna try an hour-long meditation session,`],
    ['07:25', `and then kind of go from there.`],
    ['07:26', `As soon as I disconnected from things at around 10:30 p.m the night before,`],
    ['07:31', `I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders.`],
    ['07:33', `The pressure that I constantly feel to keep going, and keep creating dissipated.`],
    ['07:38', `So, I just completed an hour-long`],
    ['07:43', `meditation session.`],
    ['07:45', `It was great.`],
    ['07:46', `But it's only 11:12 a.m. still,`],
    ['07:51', `so we're not even in the afternoon yet,`],
    ['07:53', `and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.`],
    ['07:58', `So I guess this is sort of where things really begin?`],
    ['08:00', `I don't know.`],
    ['08:01', `Today's really meant to be a very low input,`],
    ['08:04', `low consumption,`],
    ['08:06', `but also low output, low creation day. It's just a day where I'm trying to just "be".`],
    ['08:14', `So looking back, this was really an amazing experience.`],
    ['08:17', `It was very difficult to not know what to do,`],
    ['08:19', `but just sitting on my balcony gave me the space to think, that I rarely give myself.`],
    ['08:25', `I know this is going to be hard to believe, but doing that alone was actually rewarding.`],
    ['08:29', `You know, when I first arrived in Mexico, there was just this amazing sense of wonder and excitement.`],
    ['08:36', `There was so much newness,`],
    ['08:38', `and so much warmth, and just fantastic energy here.`],
    ['08:43', `And I feel like in the last few weeks I've kind of lost a little bit of that.`],
    ['08:47', `I've taken things a little bit more for granted.`],
    ['08:49', `It's been harder for me to feel grateful,`],
    ['08:54', `and, I don't know, I already kind of feel like it's coming back a little bit.`],
    ['08:59', `Just this time that I'm taking appreciating my life.`],
    ['09:02', `I feel like that excitement is kind of coming back a little bit. I don't know.`],
    ['09:07', `I could feel my mind thanking me for the permission to rest and recover,`],
    ['09:12', `kind of like giving water to a dying plant.`],
    ['09:17', `Thinking of taking a little walk in the park to reflect a little bit more. I'm pretty amazed that it's been almost,`],
    ['09:25', `I guess, 20 hours since I've eaten anything.`],
    ['09:28', `I feel completely fine.`],
    ['09:33', `That's kind of cool.`],
    ['09:34', `This is actually reminding me a lot of childhood,`],
    ['09:37', `because before I was a teenager, especially as a younger kid,`],
    ['09:41', `my life still wasn't completely on the internet,`],
    ['09:45', `you know connected, constantly getting updates,`],
    ['09:48', `notifications, like it was a different existence basically to the one that I know now.`],
    ['09:52', `That also feels like the last time I really felt`],
    ['09:55', `boredom, you know having wide expanses of time`],
    ['09:59', `where I could just think and imagine stuff.`],
    ['10:02', `Yeah...`],
    ['10:04', `Strange. Really strange.`],
    ['10:06', `I was just looking in the mirror and realizing, like I'm a young man.`],
    ['10:11', `You know, what happened?`],
    ['10:13', `Where did my childhood go? Where did my teenage years go?`],
    ['10:18', `I'm already like an adult.`],
    ['10:22', `And it's just strange sometimes to sort of realize that.`],
    ['10:29', `And that I'm in this stage of life now.`],
    ['10:31', `I'm realizing I feel insanely rested.`],
    ['10:34', `I don't even remember the last time I felt`],
    ['10:37', `this rested,`],
    ['10:39', `and it's amazing. I just feel very clear mentally.`],
    ['10:44', `I crossed paths with a friend walking over here.`],
    ['10:47', `We had a little conversation,`],
    ['10:49', `and I just felt very present to the conversation, to what he was saying,`],
    ['10:53', `to what I was saying.`],
    ['10:57', `It's really nice.`],
    ['10:59', `Thought about how we create schedules, and deadlines, and stress, to keep moving forward.`],
    ['11:04', `But for what?`],
    ['11:05', `At some level these are imaginary restrictions that we place on ourselves.`],
    ['11:11', `I say I want the freedom to screw up and to go at my pace,`],
    ['11:14', `and yet I don't even give myself permission to do those things.`],
    ['11:20', `All right, I'm gonna do`],
    ['11:22', `some more meditation because I got nothing else to do.`],
    ['11:26', `The day is getting kind of long.`],
    ['11:30', `I saw this coming for sure.`],
    ['11:35', `My first meal after the experience was just beans and rice and tortillas, but it was...`],
    ['11:41', `Incredible.`],
    ['11:42', `Between the night before, the nap that I took, and the night after, I slept something like 21 hours.`],
    ['11:47', `Which I mean, what does that tell you?`],
    ['11:49', `Also without being too cliché,`],
    ['11:51', `I mean, I do feel like doing this kind of thing`],
    ['11:53', `helped me be at least a little bit more appreciative`],
    ['11:56', `of some of the incredible things that we have, like unlimited access to`],
    ['12:01', `the world's music whenever I want it.`],
    ['12:03', `I want to make it abundantly clear that I am NOT a health expert in any way.`],
    ['12:08', `I'm just a kid on the internet.`],
    ['12:11', `So I'm not recommending that you do any of this without doing your own research.`],
    ['12:15', `I just wanted to share my experience because I found that this was very effective in helping you get back on track,`],
    ['12:21', `and like, recalibrating.`],
    ['12:23', `if you enjoyed this video,`],
    ['12:24', `consider subscribing for more, or you can follow me on Instagram`],
    ['12:28', `to keep up with some of these personal experiments that I do.`],
    ['12:31', `You can also support this project on Patreon,`],
    ['12:35', `and I think what I'm going to do is create a bonus video on there`],
    ['12:38', `answering some of the questions that you guys have`],
    ['12:40', `about this whole dopamine experiment that I did.`],
    ['12:43', `And finally, I have a newsletter.`],
    ['12:47', `Yeah.`],
    ['12:47', `Alright. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you guys soon!`]
