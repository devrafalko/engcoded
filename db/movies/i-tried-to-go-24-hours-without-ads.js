    ['00:00', `Let's face it, whether we like it or not ads are everywhere.`],
    ['00:03', `They've become an integral part of almost every aspect of our lives.`],
    ['00:07', `They're on billboards, and on the radio.`],
    ['00:09', `They've gone from the small screen, to the even smaller screens in our pockets.`],
    ['00:13', `Believe it or not, I'm actually not against ads at all.`],
    ['00:16', `As a filmmaker I used to make a living working on the sets of commercials for brands like Nike,`],
    ['00:21', `Adidas, Coca Cola, and like Mexican cleaning products.`],
    ['00:25', `I even acted in this really hilarious and very strange spot`],
    ['00:30', `for a Chinese tech company once.`],
    ['00:33', `Don't ask me what it was for.`],
    ['00:35', `To this day I don't know what I was doing.`],
    ['00:37', `Ads are the reason we live in the age of so many free products,`],
    ['00:40', `like Google, YouTube, Spotify.`],
    ['00:43', `And that's amazing. I mean ads make a lot of stuff possible.`],
    ['00:46', `Of course, you can usually pay to not see ads but most of us don't.`],
    ['00:51', `I mean ads feel harmless.`],
    ['00:53', `They're only five seconds. Right?`],
    ['00:54', `What concerns me is their omnipresence.`],
    ['00:57', `It feels like they're inescapable.`],
    ['00:59', `How many ads do we consume a day?`],
    ['01:01', `This is gonna sound kind of melodramatic but I kind of feel like they pollute our minds`],
    ['01:06', `with distractions and temptations for stuff that we usually don't need.`],
    ['01:10', `So in an attempt to see how soaked our world is in ads,`],
    ['01:13', `I've decided to try to do 24 hours of adblock`],
    ['01:17', `like the Chrome extension,`],
    ['01:19', `but in real life.`],
    ['01:20', `And I want to treat this kind of like a video game.`],
    ['01:22', `Let me explain.`],
    ['01:24', `Now, obviously I could just avoid these websites,`],
    ['01:26', `or just turn on my ad blocker and not leave my apartment,`],
    ['01:30', `but what fun would that be?`],
    ['01:31', `I live in Mexico City and there's a world of things to see out there.`],
    ['01:35', `So I've decided to give myself three challenges like three levels in a video game of increasing difficulty.`],
    ['01:40', `Level one. Get to a coffee shop without looking at or hearing a single ad.`],
    ['01:45', `I've selected a coffee shop that's about 10 minutes away,`],
    ['01:48', `and if I fail, I have to start back over at this apartment.`],
    ['01:51', `Level 2. Go to a mall.`],
    ['01:54', `Level 3. Boss mode. I'm gonna try going to "El Centro Hist√≥rico",`],
    ['01:58', `like the city center,`],
    ['02:00', `which is just saturated with media,`],
    ['02:03', `and people, and businesses, and all kinds of stuff.`],
    ['02:07', `I don't even know if it's possible if I can do this, but I'm gonna try.`],
    ['02:10', `Alright, there's no time to waste. Let's do this thing.`],
    ['02:19', `So I think an important first step here is to identify the potential enemy.`],
    ['02:23', `I noticed a lot of ads on trucks, and on buildings, and of course billboards, so gotta be mindful not to`],
    ['02:30', `look up and,`],
    ['02:32', `you know, ruin this entire mission.`],
    ['02:34', `Okay, I didn't look, but I'm pretty sure there are posters right here on the post.`],
    ['02:39', `I'm not looking. Not looking.`],
    ['02:42', `But I think that counts as an ad, so we're gonna keep going.`],
    ['02:46', `Okay, my first failure.`],
    ['02:49', `That caught my eye and that is definitely an ad.`],
    ['02:52', `It's saying to save eighty percent of whatever money that they want from you.`],
    ['02:57', `So I'm gonna have to start over.`],
    ['02:59', `I hadn't even been walking for three minutes and I failed.`],
    ['03:03', `See, that's what I'm talking about.`],
    ['03:05', `That's an ad right there.`],
    ['03:07', `That's another ad right there.`],
    ['03:09', `They're really hard to avoid.`],
    ['03:11', `See? Bingo! There's another one.`],
    ['03:13', `Alrighty.`],
    ['03:14', `This is attempt #2. Let's do this thing.`],
    ['03:19', `I mean come on the caffe is only like 10 minutes away.`],
    ['03:22', `Shouldn't be that hard.`],
    ['03:25', `This is just about as far as I made it last time, so we're at the checkpoint.`],
    ['03:29', `Eyes on the prize people.`],
    ['03:31', `Can't fail now.`],
    ['03:33', `There are definitely a lot of ads over there.`],
    ['03:35', `I feel like I saw some posters with the corner of my eye.`],
    ['03:38', `We're not going in that direction.`],
    ['03:39', `Okay, I'm almost there. I feel like I can taste victory.`],
    ['03:43', `I just try not to lift my eyes too much to be able to see any ads.`],
    ['03:50', `Level one successfully complete.`],
    ['03:52', `The coffee shop's right there.`],
    ['03:54', `So I made it.`],
    ['03:55', `I feel good. I'm feeling good about myself right now. Not gonna lie.`],
    ['03:59', `I tried explaining to the people that worked there what I was trying to do,`],
    ['04:02', `and I don't think they fully understood.`],
    ['04:05', `I asked the guy next to me if he thought I could live a whole day ad free.`],
    ['04:13', `Level 2. Let's do this thing.`],
    ['04:18', `Okay. They gave me like a mall, basically for my level 2 challenge.`],
    ['04:24', `It's like over a mile away.`],
    ['04:26', `That's an ad. They got me.`],
    ['04:28', `2 for like almost twenty pesos.`],
    ['04:33', `Alright, back to the caffe I go.`],
    ['04:38', `At this point,`],
    ['04:39', `I've got to take a moment to say something about this experiment.`],
    ['04:42', `While I was at the coffee shop a man walked in with a huge Levi's logo on his shirt.`],
    ['04:47', `It dawned on me that there's free advertising everywhere,`],
    ['04:50', `which most of us partake in voluntarily.`],
    ['04:53', `As I left the coffee shop and walked towards the mall that the barista sent me to,`],
    ['04:57', `a sinking feeling began to appear in my stomach.`],
    ['05:00', `The words of the guy that sat next to me in the coffee shop started to ring just a little too true.`],
    ['05:08', `But I'm a storyteller and I knew I was just scratching the surface.`],
    ['05:15', `This does not feel possible at all.`],
    ['05:18', `It's just you can't navigate you can't look up and see where you're going, or where you want to go.`],
    ['05:22', `There's just ads everywhere.`],
    ['05:24', `Right now, I'm in a very commercial area`],
    ['05:26', `and it's just it's everywhere I've seen like probably a hundred ads out of the corner of my eyes.`],
    ['05:32', `Does that count? I don't know`],
    ['05:34', `This is starting to feel like an impossible mission.`],
    ['05:36', `For the sake of this video though, we're gonna say I completed level two.`],
    ['05:39', `It's on to level three. We're going to the center of town.`],
    ['05:44', `Let's do this thing.`],
    ['05:46', `The history of advertising is long and complicated.`],
    ['05:49', `Really it's nothing new.`],
    ['05:50', `It has evolved as we have and with each new wave of technology`],
    ['05:54', `it has come to play a new role in our lives.`],
    ['05:57', `Again, I've always disliked commercial breaks and interruptions,`],
    ['06:01', `but at the same time I don't hate them.`],
    ['06:02', `I know why they exist and what they do.`],
    ['06:05', `It's very likely your favorite podcast or YouTube channel is successfully running`],
    ['06:09', `because of advertising or sponsorship related deals.`],
    ['06:13', `So in a way ads fund a lot of the things we take value from in our lives.`],
    ['06:19', `There just doesn't seem to be a respite.`],
    ['06:26', `This last part of the challenge really did not go as planned.`],
    ['06:31', `Before I even arrived I knew it was going to be impossible.`],
    ['06:34', `Still, I couldn't believe my eyes.`],
    ['06:36', `Wow, what a world we live in.`],
    ['06:39', `Who knew everybody wanted my money so badly?`],
    ['06:41', `That's an ad right there.`],
    ['06:44', `There were a lot of people selling contacts and one guy even smacked me as I walked by.`],
    ['06:49', `As I darted through the crowds I thought about all the times I bought something I didn't mean.`],
    ['06:53', `I take responsibility for my actions. It was me who handed over the credit card after all.`],
    ['06:58', `But boy, are there a lot of psychological games out there.`],
    ['07:02', `And this is just me being melodramatic.`],
    ['07:08', `Such a wannabe actor.`],
    ['07:12', `I think we've seen enough here.`],
    ['07:17', `That really was not what I was expecting.`],
    ['07:19', `Although, I'm not sure what I was expecting.`],
    ['07:22', `First of all, I want to share some advice if you're looking to reduce the amount of visual clutter that ads can sometimes present.`],
    ['07:27', `I think a great place to start is by reducing`],
    ['07:30', `notifications on your phone and on your computer.`],
    ['07:32', `I make sure that Do Not Disturb`],
    ['07:34', `is on for most of the day,`],
    ['07:36', `so that I don't get a lot of those spammy text messages or marketing emails.`],
    ['07:40', `Of course digital minimalism in general can be helpful,`],
    ['07:43', `and I did a whole series on that, so consider checking that out.`],
    ['07:46', `Consider installing and using an ad blocker,`],
    ['07:49', `although I think it's important to recognize`],
    ['07:51', `the implications that that holds.`],
    ['07:53', `It will save you a lot of time and maybe a little bit of money.`],
    ['07:56', `And I always say that if you want to support an artist that you really like,`],
    ['07:59', `there are always other ways to do so.`],
    ['08:01', `More than anything though,`],
    ['08:02', `I think my biggest piece of advice would be to be as intentional as possible`],
    ['08:06', `with where and how you spend your time.`],
    ['08:08', `I don't go to malls anymore because I frankly I find that very overwhelming,`],
    ['08:12', `and it's just not a positive experience for me.`],
    ['08:15', `And as you can maybe tell by the echo in this room`],
    ['08:18', `I've decided to take a really minimalist approach to my own bedroom`],
    ['08:22', `because I find that that's a great way to reset from`],
    ['08:25', `sometimes the saturation and`],
    ['08:28', `visual overload that exists out there.`],
    ['08:30', `It might be an interesting experiment to pay attention to every single ad in your life`],
    ['08:35', `for an entire day, or an entire week and see what happens.`],
    ['08:39', `See where that takes you.`],
    ['08:40', `I want to finish this piece by saying`],
    ['08:41', `that I decided to turn off ads for this video,`],
    ['08:44', `because I feel like it would be contradictory to the message and you know`],
    ['08:48', `I don't want to be a hypocrite.`],
    ['08:49', `I do have ads turned on for my other videos because I'm trying really hard to make a living doing this.`],
    ['08:55', `You know, telling stories and creating videos.`],
    ['08:57', `I may have sponsors down the road,`],
    ['08:59', `but I can promise you it will always be for products or companies that I like,`],
    ['09:03', `that I believe in.`],
    ['09:04', `However, there are no sponsors yet,`],
    ['09:06', `and the best way to support this project,`],
    ['09:08', `to support this channel,`],
    ['09:10', `is to check out my Patreon page`],
    ['09:11', `where I offer exclusive content like behind the scenes or bonus episodes.`],
    ['09:16', `Truly, any contribution makes a huge difference`],
    ['09:19', `because the reality is that Adsense doesn't pay super great.`],
    ['09:22', `I make something like three to four dollars on average per video that I post on here.`],
    ['09:27', `That's enough for some delicious "taquitos" here in Mexico,`],
    ['09:30', `but it's not quite enough to make a living.`],
    ['09:32', `Now, of course, there is no obligation and I'm more than happy to share my stuff for free online.`],
    ['09:37', `I think that's the beauty of the internet.`],
    ['09:39', `If you're just interested in following along you can sign up to my newsletter,`],
    ['09:42', `or follow me on Instagram.`],
    ['09:44', `I really hope you enjoyed this video.`],
    ['09:46', `Definitely push my boundaries.`],
    ['09:48', `Believe it or not, I'm not much of a blogger, so filming out in public still makes me kind of uncomfortable`],
    ['09:55', `especially being like, you know, like an English speaker and American here in Mexico.`],
    ['10:00', `I hate to perpetuate those stereotypes, but..`],
    ['10:04', `It is what it is.`],
    ['10:05', `Alrighty. I'll see you soon.`]
