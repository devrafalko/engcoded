    ['00:00', `Imagine you were alive back in the 1980's,`],
    ['00:03', `and were told that computers would soon take over everything:`],
    ['00:06', `from shopping, to dating, and the stock market,`],
    ['00:10', `that billions of people would be connected via a kind of web,`],
    ['00:14', `that you would own a handheld device, orders of magnitudes more powerful than supercomputers.`],
    ['00:19', `It would seem absurd, but then, all of it happened.`],
    ['00:23', `Science fiction became our reality, and we don't even think about it.`],
    ['00:28', `We're at a similar point today with genetic engineering.`],
    ['00:31', `So, let's talk about it.`],
    ['00:33', `Where it came from, what we're doing right now,`],
    ['00:36', `and about a recent breakthrough, that will change how we live and what we perceive as normal, forever.`],
    ['00:56', `Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years.`],
    ['00:59', `Through selective breeding, we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals.`],
    ['01:04', `We became very good at this, but never fully understood how it worked.`],
    ['01:08', `Until we discovered the code of life, Deoxyribonucleic Acid—DNA.`],
    ['01:13', `A complex molecule that guides the growth, development, function, and reproduction of everything alive.`],
    ['01:20', `Information is encoded in the structure of the molecule.`],
    ['01:23', `Four nucleotides are paired and make up a code that carries instructions.`],
    ['01:28', `Change the instructions and you change the being carrying it.`],
    ['01:32', `As soon as DNA was discovered, people tried to tinker with it.`],
    ['01:36', `In the 1960's, scientist bombarded plants with radiation to cause random mutations in the genetic code.`],
    ['01:43', `The idea was to get a useful plant variation by pure chance.`],
    ['01:47', `Sometimes it actually worked too.`],
    ['01:49', `In the 70's, scientists inserted DNA snippets into bacteria, plants, and animals`],
    ['01:54', `to study and modify them for research, medicine, agriculture, and for fun.`],
    ['02:00', `The earliest genetically modified animal was born in 1974, making mice a standard tool for research, saving millions of lives.`],
    ['02:08', `In the 80's, we got commercial. The first patent was given for a microbe engineered to absorb oil.`],
    ['02:15', `Today we produce many chemicals by means of engineered life,`],
    ['02:18', `like life-saving clotting factors, growth hormones, and insulin.`],
    ['02:22', `All things we had to harvest from the organs of animals before that.`],
    ['02:26', `The first food modified in the lab went on sale in 1994: the Flavr Savr tomato,`],
    ['02:32', `a tomato given a much longer shelf life where an extra gene that suppresses the build-up of a rotting enzyme.`],
    ['02:38', `But GM food and the controversy surrounding them deserve a video of their own.`],
    ['02:43', `In the 1990's, there was also a brief foray into human engineering.`],
    ['02:47', `To treat maternal infertility, babies were made that carried genetic information from 3 humans.`],
    ['02:53', `Making them the first humans ever to have 3 genetic parents.`],
    ['02:58', `Today there are super muscled pigs, fast-growing salmon, featherless chicken, and see-through frogs.`],
    ['03:04', `On the fun side, we made things glow in the dark.`],
    ['03:07', `Fluorescent zebrafish are available for as little as ten dollars.`],
    ['03:11', `All of this is already very impressive, but until recently`],
    ['03:14', `gene editing was extremely expensive, complicated, and took a long time to do.`],
    ['03:20', `This has now changed with a revolutionary new technology now entering the stage—CRISPR.`],
    ['03:27', `Overnight, the costs of engineering have shrunk by 99 %.`],
    ['03:31', `Instead of a year, it takes a few weeks to conduct experiments, and basically everybody with a lab can do it.`],
    ['03:38', `It's hard to get across how big a technical revolution CRISPR is.`],
    ['03:42', `It literally has the potential to change humanity forever.`],
    ['03:46', `Why did this sudden revolution happen and how does it work?`],
    ['03:54', `Bacteria and viruses have been fighting since the dawn of life.`],
    ['03:59', `So-called bacteriophages or phages hunt bacteria.`],
    ['04:03', `In the ocean, phages kill 40 % of them every single day.`],
    ['04:07', `Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over to use them as factories.`],
    ['04:13', `The bacteria tried to resist but failed most the time because their protection tools are too weak,`],
    ['04:19', `But sometimes bacteria survive an attack.`],
    ['04:22', `Only if they do so can they activate their most effective antivirus system:`],
    ['04:27', `they save a part of the virus DNA in their own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR.`],
    ['04:34', `Here it's stored safely until it's needed.`],
    ['04:37', `When the virus attacks again, the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive and arms a secret weapon—a protein called CAS9.`],
    ['04:47', `The protein now scans the bacterium's insides for signs of the virus invader`],
    ['04:51', `by comparing every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive.`],
    ['04:56', `When it finds a 100-percent perfect match,`],
    ['04:59', `it's activated and cuts out the virus DNA, making it useless, protecting the bacterium against the attack.`],
    ['05:06', `What's special is that CAS9 is very precise, almost like a DNA surgeon.`],
    ['05:12', `The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is programmable.`],
    ['05:17', `You can just give it a copy of DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living cell.`],
    ['05:23', `If the old techniques of genetic manipulation were like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system.`],
    ['05:28', `Aside from being precise, cheap, and easy, CRISPR offers the ability to edit live cells,`],
    ['05:34', `to switch genes on and off, and target and study particular DNA sequences.`],
    ['05:39', `It also works for every type of cell: microorganisms, plants, animals, or humans.`],
    ['05:45', `But despite the revolution CRISPR is for science, it's still just a first generation tool.`],
    ['05:51', `More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak.`],
    ['06:00', `In 2015, scientists use CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of living cells`],
    ['06:04', `from patients in the lab, proving that it was possible.`],
    ['06:08', `Only about a year later, they carried out a larger scale project with rats`],
    ['06:11', `that had the HIV virus in basically all of their body cells.`],
    ['06:15', `By simply injecting CRISPR into the rats tails,`],
    ['06:18', `they were able to remove more than 50 % of the virus from cells all over the body.`],
    ['06:23', `In a few decades, a CRISPR therapy might cure HIV and other retroviruses,`],
    ['06:28', `viruses that hide inside human DNA like Herpes could be eradicated this way.`],
    ['06:34', `CRISPR could also defeat one of our worst enemies—cancer.`],
    ['06:39', `Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while concealing themselves from the immune system.`],
    ['06:45', `CRISPR gives us the means to edit your immune cells and make them better cancer hunters.`],
    ['06:50', `Getting rid of cancer might eventually mean`],
    ['06:52', `getting just a couple of injections of a few thousand of your own cells`],
    ['06:55', `that have been engineered in the lab to heal you for good.`],
    ['06:59', `The first clinical trial for a CRISPR cancer treatment on human patients was approved in early 2016 in the US.`],
    ['07:06', `Not even a month later, Chinese scientists announced that they would treat lung cancer patients`],
    ['07:10', `with immune cells modified with CRISPR in August 2016.`],
    ['07:14', `Things are picking up pace quickly.`],
    ['07:16', `And then there are genetic diseases.`],
    ['07:19', `There are thousands of them and they range from mildly annoying to deadly or entail decades of suffering.`],
    ['07:25', `With a powerful tool like CRISPR, we may be able to end this.`],
    ['07:30', `Over 3,000 genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in your DNA.`],
    ['07:36', `We are already building a modified version of CAS9 that is made to change just a single letter, fixing the disease in the cell.`],
    ['07:43', `In a decade or two, we could possibly cure thousands of diseases forever.`],
    ['07:48', `But all of these medical applications have one thing in common:`],
    ['07:51', `they are limited to the individual and die with them,`],
    ['07:55', `except if you use them on reproductive cells or very early embryos.`],
    ['07:59', `But CRISPR can and probably will be used for much more:`],
    ['08:03', `the creation of modified humans—designer babies—and will mean gradual,`],
    ['08:08', `but irreversible changes to the human gene pool.`],
    ['08:17', `The means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exists.`],
    ['08:21', `Though the technology is still in its early stages, but it has already been attempted twice.`],
    ['08:27', `In 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientists experimented with human embryos and were partially successful on their second attempt.`],
    ['08:35', `They showed the enormous challenges we still face in gene editing embryos,`],
    ['08:39', `but also that scientists are working on solving them.`],
    ['08:42', `This is like the computer in the 70's. There will be better computers.`],
    ['08:48', `Regardless of your personal take on genetic engineering, it will affect you.`],
    ['08:53', `Modified humans could alter the genome of our entire species, because their engineered traits will be passed on to their children`],
    ['08:59', `and could spread over generations, slowly modifying the whole gene pool of humanity.`],
    ['09:04', `It will start slowly. The first designer babies will not be overly designed.`],
    ['09:09', `It's most likely that they will be created to eliminate a deadly genetic disease running in a family.`],
    ['09:14', `As the technology progresses and gets more refined, more and more people may argue that not using genetic modification is unethical,`],
    ['09:21', `because it condemns children to preventable suffering and death and denies them the cure.`],
    ['09:27', `But as soon as the first engineered kid is born, a door is opened that can't be closed anymore.`],
    ['09:33', `Early on, vanity traits will mostly be left alone.`],
    ['09:36', `But as genetic modification becomes more accepted and our knowledge of our genetic code enhances, the temptation will grow.`],
    ['09:44', `If you make your offspring immune to Alzheimer, why not also give them an enhanced metabolism?`],
    ['09:50', `Why not throw in perfect eyesight?`],
    ['09:52', `How about height or muscular structure?`],
    ['09:55', `Full hair?`],
    ['09:56', `How about giving your child the gift of extraordinary intelligence?`],
    ['10:00', `Huge changes are made as a result of the personal decisions of millions of individuals that accumulate.`],
    ['10:06', `This is a slippery slope. Modified humans could become the new standard.`],
    ['10:11', `But as engineering becomes more normal and our knowledge improves,`],
    ['10:15', `we could solve the single biggest mortality risk factor: aging.`],
    ['10:20', `Two-thirds of the 150,000 people who died today will die of age-related causes.`],
    ['10:26', `Currently we think aging is caused by the accumulation of damage to our cells,`],
    ['10:30', `like DNA breaks and the systems responsible for fixing those wearing off over time.`],
    ['10:35', `But there are also genes that directly affect aging.`],
    ['10:39', `A combination of genetic engineering and other therapy could stop or slow down aging, maybe even reverse it.`],
    ['10:46', `We know from nature that there are animals immune to aging.`],
    ['10:49', `Maybe we could even borrow a few genes for ourselves.`],
    ['10:53', `Some scientists even think biological aging could be something that eventually just stops being a thing.`],
    ['10:59', `We would still die at some point, but instead of doing so in hospitals at age 90,`],
    ['11:04', `we might be able to spend a few thousand years with our loved ones.`],
    ['11:08', `Research into this is in its infancy,`],
    ['11:12', `and many scientists are rightly skeptical about the end of aging.`],
    ['11:16', `The challenges are enormous and maybe it is unachievable,`],
    ['11:20', `but it is conceivable the people alive today might be the first to profit from effective anti aging therapy.`],
    ['11:27', `All we might need is for someone to convince a smart billionaire to make it their next problem to solve.`],
    ['11:32', `On a bigger scale, we certainly could solve many problems by having a modified population.`],
    ['11:37', `Engineered humans might be better equipped to cope with high-energy food,`],
    ['11:41', `eliminating many diseases of civilization like obesity.`],
    ['11:44', `In possession of a modified immune system, with a library of potential threats,`],
    ['11:49', `we might become immune to most diseases that haunt us today.`],
    ['11:53', `Even further into the future, we could engineer humans to be equipped for extended space travel`],
    ['11:58', `and to cope with different conditions on another planets,`],
    ['12:02', `which would be extremely helpful in keeping us alive in our hostile universe.`],
    ['12:11', `Still, a few major challenges await us: some technological, some ethical.`],
    ['12:17', `Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and fear that we will create a world in which we will reject non-perfect humans`],
    ['12:23', `and pre-select features and qualities based on our idea of what's healthy.`],
    ['12:28', `The thing is we are already living in this world.`],
    ['12:31', `Tests for dozens of genetic diseases or complications have become standard for pregnant women in much of the world.`],
    ['12:38', `Often the mere suspicion of a genetic defect can lead to the end of a pregnancy.`],
    ['12:44', `Take Down syndrome for example, one of the most common genetic defects.`],
    ['12:48', `In Europe, about 92 % of all pregnancies where it's detected are terminated.`],
    ['12:54', `The decision to terminate pregnancy is incredibly personal,`],
    ['12:57', `but it's important to acknowledge the reality that we are pre-selecting humans based on medical conditions.`],
    ['13:03', `There is also no use in pretending this will change,`],
    ['13:05', `so we have to act carefully and respectfully as we advance the technology and can make more and more selections.`],
    ['13:12', `But none of this will happen soon.`],
    ['13:15', `As powerful as CRISPR is—and it is, it's not infallible yet.`],
    ['13:20', `Wrong edits still happen as well as unknown errors that can occur anywhere in the DNA and might go unnoticed.`],
    ['13:26', `The gene edit might achieve the desired result—disabling a disease,`],
    ['13:30', `but also might accidentally trigger unwanted changes.`],
    ['13:34', `We just don't know enough yet about the complex interplay of our genes to avoid unpredictable consequences.`],
    ['13:40', `Working on accuracy and monitoring methods is a major concern as the first human trials begin.`],
    ['13:46', `And since we've discussed a possible positive future, there are darker visions too.`],
    ['13:52', `Imagine what a state like North Korea could do if they embraced genetic engineering.`],
    ['13:57', `Could a state cement its rule forever by forcing gene editing on their subjects?`],
    ['14:02', `What would stop a totalitarian regime from engineering an army of modified super soldiers?`],
    ['14:08', `It is doable in theory.`],
    ['14:10', `Scenarios like this one are far, far off into the future, if they ever become possible at all.`],
    ['14:15', `But the basic proof of concept for genetic engineering like this already exists today.`],
    ['14:20', `The technology really is that powerful.`],
    ['14:23', `While this might be a tempting reason to ban genetic editing and related research, that would certainly be a mistake.`],
    ['14:30', `Banning human genetic engineering would only lead to the science wandering off`],
    ['14:34', `to a place with jurisdiction and rules that we are uncomfortable with.`],
    ['14:38', `Only by participating can we make sure that further research is guided by caution, reason, oversight, and transparency.`],
    ['14:50', `Do you feel uncomfortable now?`],
    ['14:52', `Most of us have something wrong with them.`],
    ['14:54', `In the future that lies ahead of us, would we have been allowed to exist?`],
    ['14:59', `The technology is certainly a bit scary, but we have a lot to gain,`],
    ['15:03', `and genetic engineering might just be a step in the natural evolution of intelligent species in the universe.`],
    ['15:09', `We might end disease.`],
    ['15:11', `We could extend our life expectancy by centuries and travel to the stars.`],
    ['15:16', `There's no need to think small when it comes to this topic.`],
    ['15:20', `Whatever your opinion on genetic engineering, the future is approaching no matter what.`],
    ['15:25', `What has been insane science fiction is about to become our new reality,`],
    ['15:30', `a reality full of opportunities and challenges.`],
    ['15:38', `Videos like this would not be possible without viewer donations on patreon.com.`],
    ['15:42', `If you want to support to explaining complicated stuff and maybe get your own bird in return, you can do so here.`],
    ['15:48', `If you want to learn more about CRISPR, we put the sources and further reading in the description.`],
    ['15:53', `More videos about the whole topic area will follow.`],
