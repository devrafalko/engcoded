    ['00:00', `Veganism is hot right now.`],
    ['00:01', `It feels like every day more and more people are trying it out.`],
    ['00:04', `It's political, it's controversial,`],
    ['00:06', `and I've decided to try going vegan for 30 days here in Mexico City,`],
    ['00:10', `but with a twist.`],
    ['00:12', `There are many great reasons why one might do this:`],
    ['00:14', `For the environmental impact, which is huge.`],
    ['00:17', `To reduce animal suffering and abuse,`],
    ['00:19', `which I think is also a very big reason.`],
    ['00:21', `Many do it to improve their health.`],
    ['00:22', `But I'm doing it for a different, more selfish reason.`],
    ['00:25', `I'm doing it for mental clarity. Let me explain.`],
    ['00:29', `I'm not a huge meat-eater,`],
    ['00:30', `but since I arrived in Mexico a month ago,`],
    ['00:32', `I started to let that go a little bit.`],
    ['00:34', `It is no secret that Mexican food is delicious,`],
    ['00:37', `and I found myself hitting the food stands on the streets pretty often.`],
    ['00:41', `Not only is the food amazing and shockingly cheap,`],
    ['00:44', `but I love the cultural aspect.`],
    ['00:46', `It's where a lot of Mexicans of all ages come together to eat.`],
    ['00:50', `And so, in a really small way,`],
    ['00:52', `I enjoyed being a part of that experience.`],
    ['00:55', `Standing there eating tacos and tlacoyos with everyone else.`],
    ['00:58', `Okay. Well this particular story isn't all fairytale.`],
    ['01:01', `I started to notice that after every single one of these`],
    ['01:04', `delicious, meaty, greasy meals,`],
    ['01:07', `it would feel kind of like I was getting hit by a train.`],
    ['01:10', `For the next three hours all physical`],
    ['01:13', `and cognitive activities would become many times more difficult.`],
    ['01:16', `I started to think about the impact that this was having on my productivity.`],
    ['01:20', `There's a name for this and you may have heard of it.`],
    ['01:22', `It's called food coma.`],
    ['01:26', `Google defines food coma also known as postprandial somnolence,`],
    ['01:30', `as a state of sleep or extreme lethargy`],
    ['01:33', `induced by the consumption of a large amount of food.`],
    ['01:36', `What I think this definition is maybe lacking is a`],
    ['01:39', `consideration regarding not just quantity, but also the quality of the food.`],
    ['01:44', `Food coma can obviously be achieved with a variety of foods.`],
    ['01:48', `Not just animal-based products.`],
    ['01:49', `Which means veganism isn't going to magically solve all of my problems.`],
    ['01:54', `However, I do feel like dairy and meats can land really heavy and are harder to digest,`],
    ['01:58', `which makes getting bogged down a lot easier.`],
    ['02:01', `Not to mention that I have no idea where these animal products are coming from.`],
    ['02:05', `The brain fog that I associate with this diet`],
    ['02:08', `is something I can no longer ignore if I am to continue my search`],
    ['02:11', `for a life of greater mental clarity.`],
    ['02:13', `So last night I had what may end up being my very last ice cream,`],
    ['02:17', `and said my goodbyes.`],
    ['02:19', `By the way, I think my logo may need to become almond milk ice cream from now on.`],
    ['02:23', `Just putting that on the record.`],
    ['02:25', `Now in my humble opinion,`],
    ['02:27', `veganism seems to suffer from a serious PR problem.`],
    ['02:31', `There's a lot of misconceptions out there,`],
    ['02:33', `differing opinions, and people that seem to push things to the extreme.`],
    ['02:36', `Either in terms of activism or in terms of dietary restrictions.`],
    ['02:40', `I'm not about that.`],
    ['02:42', `I just want to enjoy what I eat and eat well, so here's my plan of attack.`],
    ['02:46', `In my fridge, you will find non-dairy alternatives to milk and butter.`],
    ['02:50', `I discovered that the cereal I was eating had honey in it`],
    ['02:53', `so that was off-limits.`],
    ['02:54', `I bought some without, it as well as toast without milk.`],
    ['02:57', `I also got myself some vegan protein powder and a variety of nuts.`],
    ['03:02', `And finally, I loaded up with fruits and veggies and started going hard on the smoothies.`],
    ['03:07', `Oh, yeah, and we cannot forget about peanut butter.`],
    ['03:13', `One of the very first things that I did to start off on`],
    ['03:16', `the right foot was to head to a local "tiangüis",`],
    ['03:18', `which is like a Mexican version of a farmer's market,`],
    ['03:20', `just that this one is around on Fridays.`],
    ['03:25', `It was actually really fun.`],
    ['03:26', `There was an amazing selection of vegetables, fruits, and nuts.`],
    ['03:31', `It's incredible walking through one of these places, there's so much going on`],
    ['03:37', `Also, I thought I would get some advice from my friend Chloé Kian,`],
    ['03:40', `another content creator online and vegan for six years.`],
    ['03:44', `For me, as somebody beginning as a vegan,`],
    ['03:46', `what would you say is like one of the biggest obstacles...`],
    ['03:49', `for somebody starting out as a vegan?`],
    ['03:53', `I think it comes down to being prepared,`],
    ['03:58', `because the habits, it will just happen`],
    ['04:02', `over time when you repeatedly eat a certain way.`],
    ['04:06', `But, I think in terms of when you're traveling or in social situations,`],
    ['04:11', `you're gonna have to think about food in advance.`],
    ['04:15', `I think that being vegan is`],
    ['04:17', `just like a whole thing`],
    ['04:19', `and there can be so many different ways to do it,`],
    ['04:22', `and it's just about`],
    ['04:23', `experimenting with different ways of eating plant-based foods,`],
    ['04:27', `and finding what works for you`],
    ['04:28', `in terms of like health, convenience.`],
    ['04:31', `I obviously care about animal suffering and the environment.`],
    ['04:35', `I think the environment is a really big one,`],
    ['04:36', `but the reason I'm actually trying this is for mental clarity.`],
    ['04:41', `So that I don't go through such deep food comas and`],
    ['04:44', `you know stuff like that.`],
    ['04:45', `Do you feel like veganism has helped you with mental clarity?`],
    ['04:50', `Yeah, for sure, especially in raw veganism.`],
    ['04:55', `Do you still go through food coma?`],
    ['04:58', `Rarely.`],
    ['04:59', `All right. Good to know.`],
    ['05:03', `It's been a little bit over a week now`],
    ['05:04', `and I wanted to give an update on how things are going so far.`],
    ['05:07', `Very quickly I realized that I was missing cooked food`],
    ['05:11', `and I made the classic mistake,`],
    ['05:13', `despite my preparations, of not eating enough filling foods.`],
    ['05:17', `So I spent the first few days hungry a lot of the time.`],
    ['05:21', `Let's just say my original plan with the smoothies wasn't exactly bulletproof,`],
    ['05:25', `but I posted on Instagram that I was going vegan`],
    ['05:28', `and a lot of you guys reached out with positive feedback,`],
    ['05:32', `positive messages, and a lot of like food suggestions and recipes.`],
    ['05:36', `That was when I started to realize that`],
    ['05:38', `food can be so much more than just something that you consume.`],
    ['05:42', `It really seems like food can bring people together.`],
    ['05:45', `I wanted to do this right`],
    ['05:47', `because it's just going vegan doesn't mean you're going to eat healthy,`],
    ['05:50', `or in a balanced way.`],
    ['05:51', `So I started to force myself`],
    ['05:53', `to try at least one new thing every single day.`],
    ['05:57', `I'm talking very, very basic here,`],
    ['06:01', `because there was a serious risk of me burning this apartment to the ground`],
    ['06:04', `if I wasn't careful.`],
    ['06:06', `I learned to cook rice, fried potatoes.`],
    ['06:09', `It was really cool, the people that I lived with started to get involved,`],
    ['06:12', `and help me make this a reality.`],
    ['06:14', `One of my roommates helped me as I struggled through my mom's very simple recipe`],
    ['06:18', `for sweet potato soup.`],
    ['06:20', `So welcome to my kitchen!`],
    ['06:23', `Today were making a rice with a variety of elements.`],
    ['06:28', `[Laughs]`],
    ['06:30', `Loser!`],
    ['06:32', `I'm so bad at this!`],
    ['06:34', `I'm still super awkward in the kitchen, but it feels like I'm expanding my repertoire.`],
    ['06:38', `Regarding the impact of veganism so far,`],
    ['06:42', `I'm feeling really really good.`],
    ['06:44', `I feel like I have a lot of energy.`],
    ['06:46', `I haven't felt food coma once since I started.`],
    ['06:50', `I'm cutting all the ingredients`],
    ['06:52', `to be prepared for this`],
    ['06:54', `incredible rice`],
    ['06:56', `that I'm gonna be making.`],
    ['07:03', `It's really hard to overeat`],
    ['07:04', `but even when I do`],
    ['07:05', `I don't feel weighed down.`],
    ['07:08', `That being said there have been a couple of occasions`],
    ['07:10', `that I wasn't able to try somebody else's food,`],
    ['07:12', `because it had cream in it or something along those lines,`],
    ['07:15', `which is kind of a bummer.`],
    ['07:17', `But, also really not the end of the world.`],
    ['07:18', `So yeah. Up to this point, I would say so far so good.`],
    ['07:23', `All right, so I am headed to the grocery store again.`],
    ['07:26', `Feels like I'm going every 2 or 3 days.`],
    ['07:28', `There's definitely a big learning curve with such a big dietary change`],
    ['07:32', `and I think that things are getting a little bit easier.`],
    ['07:35', `I think is just a question of just sticking with it and and incrementally getting better,`],
    ['07:40', `learning recipes,`],
    ['07:41', `getting comfortable with things.`],
    ['07:43', `Just like with anything in life`],
    ['07:44', `I think that the more that you put in the more that you'll get out.`],
    ['07:48', `I took a quick two-day trip to LA for a little work opportunity that popped up`],
    ['07:52', `and kept things vegan over there.`],
    ['07:53', `In fact, I tried the impossible burger while I was there`],
    ['07:56', `and it was pretty impressive.`],
    ['07:58', `[Laughs]`],
    ['08:01', `I am missing the taste of meat,`],
    ['08:04', `So today I'm gonna go get some vegan tacos,`],
    ['08:07', `and see what I can find here in Mexico City.`],
    ['08:10', `The vegan tacos not only surpassed my expectations,`],
    ['08:12', `they honestly satisfied my desire to eat meat`],
    ['08:15', `with no animals harmed in the process.`],
    ['08:22', `That was delicious!`],
    ['08:27', `I successfully completed my month as a vegan a couple of days ago,`],
    ['08:30', `And since then I've just been spending some time reflecting on things,`],
    ['08:34', `and thinking about where I want to go from here.`],
    ['08:36', `Let me start off by saying that this was a wonderful experience,`],
    ['08:40', `and you don't stand to lose anything by giving it a shot.`],
    ['08:43', `I learned a ton about food.`],
    ['08:44', `I learned a ton about cooking.`],
    ['08:46', `And yeah, I mean it really was a`],
    ['08:49', `very cool new experience.`],
    ['08:51', `Being vegan definitely demands a lot more from you,`],
    ['08:54', `but I think that it also gives more in return.`],
    ['08:57', `It does require more energy and effort`],
    ['08:58', `but at the same time I feel like I did have a lot more energy,`],
    ['09:02', `a lot more sustained energy throughout the day and`],
    ['09:05', `I do feel like there is a solid link between mental clarity and eating`],
    ['09:09', `foods that are easier to digest,`],
    ['09:11', `and you know healthier for you.`],
    ['09:12', `I already talked about this earlier in this video,`],
    ['09:14', `but it was a challenge to kind of adapt to things at first.`],
    ['09:17', `However, I do feel like things got progressively easier`],
    ['09:21', `and to be perfectly honest with you,`],
    ['09:23', `I hardly thought about it this last week.`],
    ['09:25', `It just kind of becomes like your new normal.`],
    ['09:27', `That's kind of just a side note.`],
    ['09:29', `I didn't do this at all to lose weight or anything like that,`],
    ['09:32', `so I didn't weigh myself and I don't know if there's been a big change.`],
    ['09:35', `However, I do feel like I kind of lost weight in my face.`],
    ['09:39', `I don't know if that's just me.`],
    ['09:41', `Recently, I was watching this video of myself`],
    ['09:44', `a few months ago,`],
    ['09:45', `and there's multiple factors at play here,`],
    ['09:48', `the focal length of the lens, the angle of the camera,`],
    ['09:52', `but still, like wow!`],
    ['09:53', `I look very different, don't I?`],
    ['09:55', `I don't know, you tell me.`],
    ['09:56', `Do you feel like there's been a physical change between now`],
    ['09:58', `and about a month ago?`],
    ['10:00', `I'm sure a lot of you guys are`],
    ['10:02', `curious to know, am I going to continue as a vegan?`],
    ['10:04', `Let me start off by saying that I think we live in a world,`],
    ['10:06', `a time in a place where things can just be pushed to an extreme.`],
    ['10:11', `There are a lot of different diets out there`],
    ['10:14', `and there's honestly just not a general consensus`],
    ['10:17', `on what the right one is. If that even exists.`],
    ['10:19', `I feel like a lot of people can get very rigid`],
    ['10:22', `and get to the point where they identify with what they consume,`],
    ['10:26', `it becomes a part of them.`],
    ['10:27', `I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.`],
    ['10:29', `I'm not here to push my agenda down anybody's throat`],
    ['10:31', `But I feel like sometimes when you push something too far,`],
    ['10:34', `you can lose some of the positive benefits.`],
    ['10:36', `I'm just saying that I don't necessarily want to go down that road`],
    ['10:39', `with regards to food and diet`],
    ['10:41', `I like to follow more general guidelines.`],
    ['10:43', `So avoiding processed food, avoiding excess,`],
    ['10:47', `and avoiding sugar, whenever possible.`],
    ['10:50', `With all that being said, I really enjoyed`],
    ['10:53', `this kind of more plant-based diet.`],
    ['10:56', `So, while I don't think I'm gonna stay as like a vegan by the book,`],
    ['11:00', `I do plan to continue`],
    ['11:02', `as I have, I just feel like it had a really positive impact on me.`],
    ['11:05', `I'm okay with reincorporating things like honey, and maybe eggs into my diet,`],
    ['11:12', `but going back to eating meat, especially unsourced meat`],
    ['11:16', `that was probably abused,`],
    ['11:18', `that has a huge environmental impact as well,`],
    ['11:21', `it's like I can't see myself going back to that.`],
    ['11:23', `It didn't feel like it was good for me.`],
    ['11:25', `Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking eating so much street food.`],
    ['11:28', `And again, just the environmental impact is something I can't ignore.`],
    ['11:32', `That being said,`],
    ['11:33', `and this is an example that I've been given a lot in the last few days,`],
    ['11:36', `but if I were, you know in Turkey, and a Turkish farmer offers me some of his goat milk,`],
    ['11:41', `I'm not gonna say no.`],
    ['11:42', `That sounds like a very weird and probably unlikely scenario,`],
    ['11:45', `but hey, who knows?`],
    ['11:47', `It could happen.`],
    ['11:48', `So while I don't plan to create`],
    ['11:50', `really rigid rules with regards to what I consume,`],
    ['11:52', `this last month showed me that it's remarkably easy, actually`],
    ['11:55', `to live without consuming animal products.`],
    ['11:59', `So I plan to kind of stick with that`],
    ['12:01', `But again, I don't plan to push my agenda on anybody.`],
    ['12:04', `I just wanted to share my experience.`],
    ['12:05', `This entire project is centered around my search for mental clarity.`],
    ['12:09', `if you enjoyed this video and want to see more content like this,`],
    ['12:12', `consider hitting that subscribe button and`],
