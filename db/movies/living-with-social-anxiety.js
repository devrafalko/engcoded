    ['04:38', `new people I didn't know that as a kid`],
    ['04:40', `that like I had just recently kind of`],
    ['04:42', `had an aha moment with that I have a lot`],

    ['04:57', `that I don't particularly know and I'm`],
    ['05:00', `kind of in a closed-off space like if`],
    ['05:02', `it's out and this is really weird but`],
    ['05:04', `like if it's out in the open I'm totally`],
    ['05:05', `fine but like if it's like in a very`],

    ['05:12', `anxious actually a lot of bit anxious`],
    ['05:14', `and it's just something I've dealt with`],
    ['05:17', `my whole life I don't know like I just`],

    ['05:34', `back into like my middle school time`],
    ['05:36', `it's kind of like the reason why I'm`],
    ['05:39', `like that is because I'm afraid of being`],
    ['05:40', `judged and I'm afraid of like people`],
    ['05:42', `picking on me or I'm afraid of someone`],
    ['05:43', `you know calling me out or something so`],
