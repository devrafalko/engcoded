    ['00:00', `This Episode of Real Engineering is brought to you by Shopify. My trusted partner for`],
    ['00:04', `merch sales. On July 19th, 2012 the Solar Dynamics Observatory`],
    ['00:13', `captured this incredible footage of Sun. This clip was recorded with 1 frame every 12 seconds.`],
    ['00:21', `Meaning every second of this video represents 6 minutes of real time. This event began with`],
    ['00:27', `an intense solar flare. A sudden release of magnetic energy sending ungodly amounts of`],
    ['00:33', `energy, in the form of radiation and light, into space. This particular solar flare was`],
    ['00:38', `followed by a coronal mass ejection, a massive twisted bubble shaped eruption firing a colossal`],
    ['00:45', `cloud of electrically charged particles into space, which can disrupt interplanetary magnetic`],
    ['00:50', `fields and interact with Earth’s magnetic field in what is known as a geomagnetic storm.`],
    ['00:56', `Finally, as the solar storm subsided and the eruption bubble began to cool, we were treated`],
    ['01:01', `to one of the most mesmerizing events in our solar system. Coronal Rain. Where the remaining`],
    ['01:07', `charged plasma cools and falls back to the surface of the sun. Forming these beautiful`],
    ['01:12', `cage like structures as the particles follow the Sun’s magnetic field lines back down.`],
    ['01:17', `[1] An astoundingly beautiful event, but had it`],
    ['01:20', `happened just a week earlier the flare up would have been pointing squarely at earth`],
    ['01:25', `and could have had some nasty consequences [2], and it wouldn’t have been the first`],
    ['01:27', `time a solar storm affected life negatively on earth.`],
    ['01:31', `In 1859 a similarly powerful solar flare, called the Carrington event, did hit earth.`],
    ['01:37', `Treating people as far south as the Carribean to the northern lights, while also knocking`],
    ['01:42', `out major telegraph systems in both Europe and North America.[3]`],
    ['01:46', `In some cases the geomagnetic disturbances were so strong that they sparked fires, shocked`],
    ['01:51', `telegraph operators and even allowed the telegraph system to work with no power.`],
    ['01:57', `In 1989 a large geomagnetic storm caused a blackout in Quebec after the coronal mass`],
    ['02:03', `ejection managed to trip circuit breakers in their grid. Leaving 6 million people without`],
    ['02:08', `power for 9 hours. So, clearly these storms have the power to`],
    ['02:12', `really mess with vital technologies that keep our society moving, but how exactly do they`],
    ['02:18', `do it? [4][5]`],
    ['02:19', `To understand this we first need to understand some basics of how electricity is generated`],
    ['02:24', `in power stations. As you probably know already, we generate electricity by moving a wire through`],
    ['02:30', `a magnetic field, or vica versa. The basic law behind this is called Faraday’s Law[6],`],
    ['02:35', `which states that “any change to a magnetic field surrounding a coil of wire will cause`],
    ['02:40', `an electromotive force to be produced, otherwise known as a voltage. The voltage can be considered`],
    ['02:46', `the force pushing electrons through a wire, if they are free to move a current is produced.`],
    ['02:53', `The current is a measure of the rate of flow of electrons.`],
    ['02:56', `We generally generate electricity by rotating a coil of wire inside a magnetic field. We`],
    ['03:02', `do it this way simply because rotational motion is efficient with no changing of direction`],
    ['03:07', `like linear motion forcing us to decelerate and lose inertia, but we can generate currents`],
    ['03:12', `other ways, like dropping a magnet through a coil of wire. This moves the magnetic field`],
    ['03:17', `itself, rather than the coil of wire. So stationary wires can generate currents`],
    ['03:23', `when a magnetic field changes around them, and our electricity grid happens to be made`],
    ['03:27', `up of millions of kilometres of stationary wire. We have effectively turned the planet`],
    ['03:32', `into a massive electric generator by surrounding the earth’s magnetic core with all this`],
    ['03:37', `conductive wire, the only thing that’s missing is a large shift in the earth’s magnetic`],
    ['03:42', `field. Unfortunately for us, that is exactly what coronal mass ejections do to Earth’s`],
    ['03:47', `magnetic field.`],
    ['03:49', `On March 10th 1989, the sun blasted a cloud of charged particles so large that it dwarfed`],
    ['03:55', `our planet in size. It raced through space at 450 kilometres per second, before crashing`],
    ['04:01', `into the Earth’s magnetopause. The boundary between Earth’s magnetosphere and interplanetary`],
    ['04:07', `space, sitting about sixty five thousand kilometres above Earth. It struck with such force that`],
    ['04:13', `it literally shook and trembled our planet’s protective magnetic field. [7]`],
    ['04:18', `The first phase of this is called the sudden storm commencement where the coronal mass`],
    ['04:23', `ejection first arrives at our magnetopause causing the magnetosphere to compress on the`],
    ['04:27', `daylight side of the earth. Resulting in a sudden increase in the intensity of the geomagnetic`],
    ['04:33', `field in that region. The next phase results in a decrease in intensity as an electric`],
    ['04:39', `current induced in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, pushes the boundary of the magnetosphere outwards`],
    ['04:45', `and results in a decrease in geomagnetic field, and the geomagnetic field can continue to`],
    ['04:50', `vary from hours to days after this initial burst.`],
    ['04:54', `So these geomagnetic storms cause shifts in the earth's magnetic field which drives induced`],
    ['05:00', `electric currents in anything capable of carrying them. That can be the ground, ocean, or our`],
    ['05:06', `electricity grid. If those currents enter our grid they can wreak havoc on essential`],
    ['05:11', `infrastructure. So it seems like a disaster waiting to happen.`],
    ['05:15', `What are we doing to prepare for the worst? Unsurprisingly, one of the largest industries`],
    ['05:20', `on Earth has thought pretty hard about this problem and has set out guidelines on how`],
    ['05:25', `to deal with such an event. As mentioned in my recent solar sailing video, we currently`],
    ['05:30', `have several satellites parked in lagrange point one. A point between the Sun and the`],
    ['05:35', `Earth where a satellite can maintain a constant position, and thus allow us to receive advance`],
    ['05:40', `warning of any coronal mass ejection. This point confused many commenters, who assumed`],
    ['05:46', `solar flares were simply bursts of radiation travelling at the speed of light, and thus`],
    ['05:51', `no speed of light communication method could give us any advance warning.`],
    ['05:55', `But these eruptions of particles travel at a fraction the speed of light, about 0.15%`],
    ['06:00', `the speed of light for our above 1989 event. (1.48x10-3) And thus can provide up to an`],
    ['06:06', `hour of warning time. We also have some other less definitive warning`],
    ['06:10', `signs that the Sun may point a coronal mass ejection in our direction by observing sunspots,`],
    ['06:16', `which are dips in brightness on the surface of the Sun, which occur as magnetic energy`],
    ['06:21', `bottles up in the solar atmosphere before being suddenly released. These sunspots come`],
    ['06:26', `in cycles of low and high activity every eleven years.`],
    ['06:30', `This warning time can provide grid operators a little time to prepare for any anomalies,`],
    ['06:36', `but they are more useful to GPS satellites whose accuracy is affected by ionosphere disturbances`],
    ['06:42', `as their radio waves refract through it [10] and thus need to adjust their signal to compensate`],
    ['06:47', `for. In severe solar storms these warnings would give industries where GPS malfunction`],
    ['06:53', `could lead to loss of life, like airliners, vital time to prepare.`],
    ['06:57', `To protect our grid, it’s really a matter of designing it in a way to be able to deal`],
    ['07:02', `with these induced currents. Let’s take a deeper look into that 1989 blackout to see`],
    ['07:07', `what really happened and see how grid operators can prepare.`],
    ['07:11', `The first malfunction occurred as a result of transformers becoming saturated. Power`],
    ['07:16', `transformers are placed at internals between high-voltage transmission lines and power`],
    ['07:20', `generators or local distribution lines to step-up or step-down voltages.`],
    ['07:26', `So what does saturation mean? Transformers work by winding wire from the source around`],
    ['07:31', `a ferromagnetic core. This generates a magnetic field inside the core which can in turn induce`],
    ['07:37', `an electric current in our secondary winding. If our primary wire has more windings that`],
    ['07:41', `the secondary wire it will step down the voltage, and if the secondary wire has more windings`],
    ['07:47', `that the primary wire it will step up the voltage. These transformers form an essential`],
    ['07:52', `part of our grid, but when the core becomes saturated it interferes with their operation.`],
    ['07:58', `Saturation just means that the magnetic core has reached is maximum magnetic flux capabilities,`],
    ['08:04', `so an increase in current and voltage will not result in a subsequent increase of magnetic`],
    ['08:09', `flux. If this happens, the voltage induced in the secondary winding can no longer match`],
    ['08:14', `the waveform as the voltage powering the primary coil. So the waveform of the secondary wire`],
    ['08:20', `becomes distorted. [12] When this happened in Quebec the grid voltage`],
    ['08:24', `became unstable causing protective relays to disconnect five high-voltage transmission`],
    ['08:29', `lines including one from a hydroelectric facility. [12]`],
    ['08:33', `As the hydroelectric facility was disconnected it experienced a rapid loss of load, meaning`],
    ['08:38', `it’s power had nowhere to go, which caused the voltage to suddenly increase which damaged`],
    ['08:43', `two step-up transformers as a result of excessive heating.`],
    ['08:48', `Saturated transformers are the route cause of most grid malfunctions during magnetic`],
    ['08:53', `storms. However In 1989, the knock-on effect of these waveform distortions is what caused`],
    ['08:58', `the majority of the damage, as electro-mechanical protective relays tripped and cut off sections`],
    ['09:04', `of the grid. [13]`],
    ['09:06', `Electro-mechanical relays are essentially switches that turn on and off when an electric`],
    ['09:10', `current flows in the control circuit creating a magnetic field in an electromagnet and pulls`],
    ['09:16', `an armature down to complete a circuit in a secondary circuit.`],
    ['09:20', `These can be combined to form logic gates that are more complicated, but are in-general`],
    ['09:24', `not programmable to deal with anomalies like distorted waveforms caused by transformer`],
    ['09:30', `saturation. Today we have much smarter microprocessor`],
    ['09:32', `technology that can be programmed to deal with these issues better and maintain grid`],
    ['09:37', `stability, but because of the electro-mechanical relay’s reliability and long service life,`],
    ['09:43', `there are still thousands of these older devices in the grid infrastructure, but they are slowly`],
    ['09:48', `being phased out for more modern technology especially in northern and southern regions`],
    ['09:53', `more susceptible to geomagnetically induced currents.`],
    ['09:57', `We can also block geomagnetically induced currents because they are direct currents,`],
    ['10:01', `where our normal power is alternating current. Capacitors can only transmit alternating current`],
    ['10:07', `because capacitors don’t physically complete circuits. They are just large stores of positive`],
    ['10:12', `and negative potentials that switch every time the current flips. DC currents don’t`],
    ['10:17', `flip and thus a capacitors do not allow DC currents to flow. So we do have options to`],
    ['10:23', `minimise the effects of these disturbances. I expected this to be a dramatic video that`],
    ['10:28', `would drag viewers in on fear of their grid failing from solar flares. You can probably`],
    ['10:33', `tell from the shift in tone from the start of the video to the end, as I researched this`],
    ['10:38', `topic more thoroughly. It really seems like mainstream media’s fear mongering on the`],
    ['10:42', `effects of solar storms on our electricity grid is completely overblown. With only one`],
    ['10:47', `notable blackout caused by geomagnetically induced currents, that with today’s technologies`],
    ['10:52', `was completely preventable, there isn’t much evidence that grid operators need to`],
    ['10:57', `spend vast amounts of money on these systems. Although DC blocking capacitor systems have`],
    ['11:02', `been installed in countries in northern locations more at risk of geomagnetic disturbances,`],
    ['11:08', `like Finland and England. [13] In the end the only reason electricity grid`],
    ['11:12', `operators have not implemented these DC blocking devices and other mitigating technologies`],
    ['11:18', `is because they would cost more to model and implement than the risk geomagnetic disturbances`],
    ['11:23', `actually pose to the grid. In reality, the risk from hurricanes and other terrestrial`],
    ['11:28', `weather events pose a much bigger risk to our electricity grid.`],
    ['11:33', `The electricity grid makes the Internet possible, and the Internet has changed the world in`],
    ['11:37', `almost every way possible, including allowing people to start and run entire businesses`],
    ['11:43', `without ever leaving their homes, reaching customers all over the world. I am able to`],
    ['11:48', `sell my graph paper notebooks, t-shirts and pins with the help of Shopify who have all`],
    ['11:52', `the tools you need to set up an online store. If you want to start your own online selling`],
    ['11:57', `business, Shopify is the perfect place to start. It has logo generators, plug and play`],
