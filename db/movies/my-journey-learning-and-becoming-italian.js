    ['00:04', `This is me, six months ago,`],
    ['00:05', `trying to say something in Italian.`],
    ['00:07', `I decided I wanted to be able to speak this language well`],
    ['00:11', `I had attempted doing this before,`],
    ['00:12', `but I never had enough confidence`],
    ['00:15', `to have an entire conversation with someone.`],
    ['00:18', `But this time was different,`],
    ['00:20', `I tried to learn as much as possible in just one week`],
    ['00:25', `and I documented the process.`],
    ['00:26', `My thinking is that learning a foreign language`],
    ['00:30', `should be something fun and exciting,`],
    ['00:34', `and not the horrific experience everyone had in school.`],
    ['00:37', `This challenge was the push I was looking for,`],
    ['00:40', `and for the first time in my life, despite it being difficult,`],
    ['00:44', `I could at least express myself.`],
    ['00:46', `I could construct complete thoughts in Italian.`],
    ['00:49', `Dante's and Leonardo da Vinci's language was coming out of my mouth...`],
    ['00:53', `Avoja! *roman slang for 'hell yeah'*.`],
    ['00:55', `But I knew I couldn't stop there.`],
    ['00:57', `My journey with this language was really just beginning.`],
    ['01:02', `Speaking Italian well enough to be able to use it with people,`],
    ['01:07', `was still a far off objective for me.`],
    ['01:09', `But I was clear on what I wanted to achieve.`],
    ['01:12', `People think that learning a new language has to take up`],
    ['01:15', `a lot of time and energy...`],
    ['01:17', `And look, learning a new language isn't easy,`],
    ['01:20', `but more than that, being consistent is key.`],
    ['01:24', `I only needed a few minutes a day to learn new words,`],
    ['01:30', `watch something - like a youtube video for example -`],
    ['01:33', `or write in Italian`],
    ['01:35', `I just kept practicing (because I'm super stubborn), even though it was - and still is -`],
    ['01:40', `very frustrating at times`],
    ['01:42', `and little by little, I was able to get better.`],
    ['01:45', `And then, at the beginning of September, I began a 3 month stay in Italy.`],
    ['01:51', `People have always told me I look like I'm Italian:`],
    ['01:55', `I'm short, hairy and I talk with my hands.`],
    ['01:57', `So, stereotypes aside, I had to see things for myself,`],
    ['02:01', `I came to see what it means to live like an Italian.`],
    ['02:06', `So this is my journey learning the Italian language.`],
    ['02:18', `Okay, let's do this: I've already made two videos about my process`],
    ['02:24', `when starting out with a foreign language,`],
    ['02:26', `so there are going to be links to those videos in the description box.`],
    ['02:31', `Otherwise, my philosophy is basically that learning a new language is a marathon.`],
    ['02:35', `You have to keep practicing:`],
    ['02:38', `Input, every day.`],
    ['02:39', `There's no secret, you simply have to keep adding to your vocabulary.`],
    ['02:44', `Little by little, starting from the most important words, as I did at the beginning,`],
    ['02:48', `to fill the gaps.`],
    ['02:50', `You absolutely have to listen to how people speak,`],
    ['02:53', `to learn common sayings, expressions, grammar...`],
    ['02:58', `The purpose of this video is to show that this process can be quite long and slow.`],
    ['03:04', `There are some resources I wanted to share with you,`],
    ['03:07', `whether you're a "foreigner" wanting to learn Italian,`],
    ['03:10', `or Italian looking for new content in Italian.`],
    ['03:15', `They're resources I've used myself.`],
    ['03:17', `And I wanted to take this moment to repeat`],
    ['03:20', `that I still struggle a lot.`],
    ['03:23', `Obviously, in making this video,`],
    ['03:27', `I'm only showing the cool moments, people that's called editing, because I'm editing.`],
    ['03:30', `And yeah, there's plenty of moments when I tell myself`],
    ['03:33', `"Wow, what an amazing language this is," and that I just like it. That I just like everything about it.`],
    ['03:37', `But there's still plenty of moments even now,`],
    ['03:40', `when I think, "jeez, I can't stand this damn language anymore,"`],
    ['03:44', `that I'm not able to say anything right.`],
    ['03:46', `Like for example, only the other day a friend told me`],
    ['03:50', `that "incredibile" isn't pronounced "incrediBBile" but "incrediBile"`],
    ['03:53', `I was pronouncing a "doppia" (when you have two consonants next to each other in Italian) when I shouldn't have,`],
    ['03:55', `And I was like, I'm an idiot!`],
    ['03:57', `Learning a foreign language isn't easy.`],
    ['04:00', `Listen to how I spoke during my first few days in Italy:`],
    ['04:04', `"Have you come....`],
    ['04:06', `to Milan today? ....`],
    ['04:10', `I think...`],
    ['04:11', `tomorrow, that way I can deal with it without... "concerns."`],
    ['04:18', `Is it a word?`],
    ['04:20', `Concerns?`],
    ['04:21', `I think so, right?`],
    ['04:25', `Ok, so, anyway, therefore, consequently. *I'm being completely obnoxious*`],
    ['04:31', `Here I am with my friend Giuseppe.`],
    ['04:35', `Right now we are`],
    ['04:37', `both in Milan,`],
    ['04:39', `and I wanted to update you on my progress. about my progress`],
    ['04:44', `I spent...`],
    ['04:45', `What am I trying to say here? Wait..`],
    ['04:47', `I spent nearly a month here in Italy.`],
    ['04:51', `Obviously, I'm still learning Italian`],
    ['04:54', `However, it's not just "proper Italian"`],
    ['04:57', `but also "spoken Italian" (how people actually talk on the streets).`],
    ['05:00', `I've learned a few new words already, like`],
    ['05:02', `CHILL, BRO`],
    ['05:03', `Like...`],
    ['05:06', `"Pig God."`],
    ['05:07', `(this is pretty much one of the worst things you can say in Italian, and there is no translation in English).`],
    ['05:10', `What do I need to do to become even more Italian?`],
    ['05:14', `The accent? The way you talk?`],
    ['05:16', `Exactly, how I improve my way of speaking.`],
    ['05:19', `These are things that, with time, you make yours.`],
    ['05:22', `Your ear (figuratively) learns to recognize these little things and helps you integrate them into how you speak.`],
    ['05:27', `You have to, how do you say, "dissect"`],
    ['05:31', `Does this word exist?`],
    ['05:33', `It's the second time that you do that.`],
    ['05:35', `"Idiomatically."`],
    ['05:36', `Yeah. (I have no idea what he's saying).`],
    ['05:37', `And not translated like with Google Translate.`],
    ['05:40', `"Idiomatically."`],
    ['05:41', `Do you really speak with your hands?`],
    ['05:43', `Do people actually do this?`],
    ['05:45', `No, you do this to little kids when..`],
    ['05:47', `Yeah, right.`],
    ['05:48', `You do this to kids when they are eating, to say: "It's tasty".`],
    ['05:52', `Do you know other gestures?`],
    ['05:59', `I can't believe it.`],
    ['06:02', `You are impossible!`],
    ['06:03', `Even in English, I still struggle`],
    ['06:07', `Yeah, it's just that, you can reach a determined level`],
    ['06:11', `in which you can say:`],
    ['06:13', `"Well, I speak Italian, fluently."`],
    ['06:17', `Really-`],
    ['06:25', `To try to speak (100%) perfectly,`],
    ['06:30', `is really a goal that does harm`],
    ['06:34', `it does harm.`],
    ['06:35', `Because it isn't possible, speaking perfectly isn't possible. (There's no such thing as perfection is what I'm trying to say here).`],
    ['06:39', `Yeah, no it's true, but still`],
    ['06:41', `you can always seek to improve.`],
    ['06:42', `If you ask yourself: "How am I speaking?"`],
    ['06:45', `"Did I use that word correctly? Did I used the right expression?"`],
    ['06:48', `You're obviously going to, like, you lose...`],
    ['06:51', `How should I put this? You lose...`],
    ['06:53', `Confidence.`],
    ['06:53', `Yeah, your confidence.`],
    ['06:55', `You don't speak Italian well.`],
    ['06:58', `I wanted to use another word`],
    ['06:59', `like "subscription".. right? (Giuseppe used the wrong word for this the last time we talked).`],
    ['07:02', `"Subscribe." (this should be iscrivetevi).`],
    ['07:05', `Can you speak, for a while, like me? (I'm asking him to imitate how I speak).`],
    ['07:08', `It's hard...`],
    ['07:09', `to do... Nathan's accent.`],
    ['07:12', `I don't know...`],
    ['07:14', `really know...what to say.`],
    ['07:17', `Do I really speak like this?`],
    ['07:19', `Yes.`],
    ['07:20', `The reason is..`],
    ['07:21', `I suck at this.`],
    ['07:23', `When I did this challenge.`],
    ['07:26', `Challange. (correct pronunciation)`],
    ['07:27', `What did I say?`],
    ['07:28', `Challenge.`],
    ['07:29', `Challenge. (still wrong)`],
    ['07:31', `Good`],
    ['07:31', `Goat! (in Italian this has a negative meaning, it's like saying "sheeple"), ignorant! (we're referencing a famous political commentator).`],
    ['07:36', `Hello guys, it's raining now`],
    ['07:38', `so I don't know for how long we'll be able to record here.`],
    ['07:41', `I've spent a little more than half of my time here`],
    ['07:45', `I didn't write anything down,`],
    ['07:46', `I didn't write a text before doing this,`],
    ['07:49', `because I really wanted to show how I can speak now`],
    ['07:54', `and also share a few thoughts`],
    ['08:00', `of my experience here so far.`],
    ['08:02', `It's been so much fun living here this time`],
    ['08:07', `because I can at least understand what happens around me.`],
    ['08:10', `I've had the opportunity to visit Italy in the past, a couple of times`],
    ['08:13', `but I couldn't speak Italian,`],
    ['08:15', `so that was a little different, you are a tourist`],
    ['08:19', `and obviously I am still a tourist`],
    ['08:22', `but this time I can at least`],
    ['08:25', `make some friendships`],
    ['08:27', `and practice, see if I can talk Italian with Italians.`],
    ['08:30', `I really enjoy saying 'vai tra' (relax, dude - Italian slang).`],
    ['08:33', `It makes me laugh.`],
    ['08:35', `What else did I want to add..`],
    ['08:37', `It's interesting to see the connection`],
    ['08:40', `between confidence and speaking a (foreign) language well.`],
    ['08:46', `So many people tell me,`],
    ['08:48', `"alcohol helps a lot!"`],
    ['08:51', `but in my opinion,`],
    ['08:52', `it's not because it makes it you smarter`],
    ['08:54', `because alcohol doesn't do that. (lol)`],
    ['08:57', `More than anything, I think it's that with alcohol,`],
    ['09:01', `you lose this fear of making mistakes`],
    ['09:06', `I've come to realize that it is not possible for me`],
    ['09:12', `to truly master Italian`],
    ['09:15', `during my time here.`],
    ['09:17', `I'm going to need to continue`],
    ['09:21', `with this language for a long time.`],
    ['09:24', `English is everywhere.`],
    ['09:26', `Escaping English has become very difficult.`],
    ['09:30', `And it makes sense, my job is in English`],
    ['09:33', `Everyone writes to me in English`],
    ['09:35', `It's beautiful isn't it? It's beautiful to be able`],
    ['09:39', `to speak the international language`],
    ['09:40', `so, I'm not complaining,`],
    ['09:45', `But, if you really want to learn`],
    ['09:48', `another language it gets a little complicated`],
    ['09:51', `Another piece of advise I wanted to share:`],
    ['09:54', `For example when I hear`],
    ['09:57', `an expression that seems important to me`],
    ['09:59', `Like for example 'per forza' (it means necessarily, adding to the idea that something really has to be done).`],
    ['10:01', `Everyone uses 'per forza'`],
    ['10:03', `When I discovered this expression`],
    ['10:07', `I wrote it down,`],
    ['10:08', `and then I started using it`],
    ['10:10', `every time I could add it in my sentences.`],
    ['10:15', `Like for example...`],
    ['10:17', `I really have go to the supermarket.`],
    ['10:20', `It becomes like a game because you are using these expressions`],
    ['10:24', `and it starts to become`],
    ['10:27', `a part of your vocabulary.`],
    ['10:30', `I hope I'll be able to improve`],
    ['10:33', `my Italian a bit more`],
    ['10:35', `during this last month that is left...`],
    ['10:38', `I guess we'll see.`],
    ['10:42', `Ok, we're here,`],
    ['10:45', `I'm here with Marcello, a friend of mine here in Italy`],
    ['10:48', `First of all, I'd like to take a moment`],
    ['10:51', `to say how astounding`],
    ['10:55', `I find the world in which we live in.`],
    ['10:57', `Simply because`],
    ['10:59', `I published something`],
    ['11:01', `on instagram saying I was in Milano...`],
    ['11:04', `you reached out to me,`],
    ['11:06', `and here we are, right?`],
    ['11:08', `We are here thanks to what we do on the internet`],
    ['11:12', `I always think about our grandparents, when they had to travel`],
    ['11:15', `what did they do?`],
    ['11:16', `Besides instagram, no google maps`],
    ['11:18', `or anything like that, we live in a different world, so much easier.`],
    ['11:22', `Exactly, exactly, and I find it incredible because all of this happened..`],
    ['11:27', `I believe you discovered my channel`],
    ['11:30', `thanks to my video in Italian, right? Yes`],
    ['11:33', `I published a video of me, just trying,`],
    ['11:36', `I couldn't speak properly`],
    ['11:38', `but trying to speak this language`],
    ['11:42', `you discovered me, you reached out to me, and here we are`],
    ['11:45', `in this moment, making this video.`],
    ['11:48', `Ok, so it's strange, because I always saw`],
    ['11:51', `Youtube in America as something that you can't reach, unattainable,`],
    ['11:55', `so I thought of you as the guy`],
    ['11:57', `who has made videos on Youtube, I had seen the video on cold showers,`],
    ['12:00', `I had seen other videos about habits`],
    ['12:03', `about the way you organize your life.. and I liked them`],
    ['12:06', `but I never thought you could come to Milano`],
    ['12:08', `because you were in Mexico, and when you arrived i thought`],
    ['12:10', `damn this is the first time a YouTuber comes to live in Milano`],
    ['12:13', `I have to meet him, i have to ask him what he does, how he does it..`],
    ['12:17', `And you know what? It's interesting you say that because`],
    ['12:20', `I had exactly the same`],
    ['12:22', `the same feeling`],
    ['12:25', `when I would think about Youtube Italy, let's say`],
    ['12:30', `and not knowing how`],
    ['12:32', `to get in touch with you guys.`],
    ['12:35', `Because what do you do when you can't even`],
    ['12:38', `understand what they are saying.`],
    ['12:40', `It's another country that you don't know well (or at all)`],
    ['12:43', `I wasn't born here, I wasn't raised here...`],
    ['12:47', `but simply the fact`],
    ['12:50', `of learning this language`],
    ['12:53', `created a bridge in a way.`],
    ['12:55', `If you didn't speak Italian`],
    ['12:58', `we might've still met,`],
    ['13:00', `Yeah because you did write to me in English.`],
    ['13:01', `Yes, but it would've been more difficult, especially for you`],
    ['13:04', `it would've been more difficult for you to meet all the other people in Italy`],
    ['13:07', `that don't really make an effort with English.`],
    ['13:10', `Plus it's different, if you speak Italian,`],
    ['13:14', `Italians will recognize`],
    ['13:16', `the importance you've given to the language`],
    ['13:17', `they are proud, they are happy that you have learned Italian`],
    ['13:20', `they feel closer to you.`],
    ['13:21', `I'm thinking if you ask for directions to an Italian on the street`],
    ['13:24', `and speak in Italian`],
    ['13:26', `they will be much more likely to respond positively.`],
    ['13:29', `Of course.`],
    ['13:30', `When I see your videos in English and when I hear you speaking in Italian`],
    ['13:33', `I feel like I'm hearing two different people speak.. as if the Italian`],
    ['13:36', `Like my personality? Yup.`],
    ['13:38', `It's different? Even now?`],
    ['13:40', `Yup, it's as if the Italian language changes your personality a bit.`],
    ['13:43', `This is the feeling I have when I see your videos in English`],
    ['13:45', `or when I hear you speak in English..`],
    ['13:47', `More serious right?`],
    ['13:48', `You're more serious perhaps because you have a better mastery of the language, but that is not the point.`],
    ['13:52', `You are more.. you seem more American to me`],
    ['13:55', `and when you speak Italian you seem more Italian to me.`],
    ['13:56', `The reality of speaking Italian and living here`],
    ['14:00', `has been an opportunity for me`],
    ['14:02', `to begin from zero.`],
    ['14:05', `because no one really knows me,`],
    ['14:08', `or put another way, no one knew me when I arrived here`],
    ['14:12', `and there's a certain freedom there`],
    ['14:15', `to do what you want to do.`],
    ['14:19', `We were recording a video for you`],
    ['14:21', `And you told me that it doesn't matter,`],
    ['14:23', `the fact that you are speaking Italian..`],
    ['14:25', `Is already a lot.`],
    ['14:26', `Being an American,`],
    ['14:28', `you don't really mind`],
    ['14:30', `when i make mistakes.`],
    ['14:32', `Exactly, it doesn't matter,`],
    ['14:34', `An Italian,`],
    ['14:34', `hearing an American that speaks in Italian, in his language`],
    ['14:38', `even if he doesn't speak it perfectly,`],
    ['14:40', `it's a beautiful thing.`],
    ['14:42', `Well, guys, I hope you liked it.`],
    ['14:45', `My time here in Italy is ending`],
    ['14:47', `but still, there are other things, about my stay here, that I wanted to show you.`],
    ['14:52', `Unfortunately`],
    ['14:54', `I couldn't put it all in one single video.`],
    ['14:58', `This is starting to get a little long.`],
    ['15:01', `So`],
    ['15:02', `there won't exactly be a part 2 to this, but`],
