    ['00:07', `Hey everyone!`],
    ['00:07', `Welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:09', `Let's talk about stress.`],
    ['00:11', `Today I want to share some tips on how to deal with stress and anxiety.`],
    ['00:16', `October was actually one of the busiest months of my year.`],
    ['00:19', `I was preparing for the launch of my new Artist of Life Workbook and the Daily Planner.`],
    ['00:24', `I was preparing for the launch event, planning all of that, which is happening very soon.`],
    ['00:28', `And also recording podcasts for the new podcast season on top of making videos for YouTube.`],
    ['00:34', `And it was my birthday, everything that life throws at you all at once.`],
    ['00:38', `It was pretty crazy.`],
    ['00:39', `So inevitably, I get pretty stressed out even though I'm trying my best to handle everything.`],
    ['00:45', `Let me just debunk the myth that stress is an inevitable part of life.`],
    ['00:49', `I don't believe that.`],
    ['00:50', `I choose not to believe that, because even though stress is very common –`],
    ['00:54', `everyone here has probably experienced stress in life – yes, life can be stressful at times.`],
    ['01:00', `I believe that if you meditate and whatever, you'll be able to achieve some state of zen`],
    ['01:06', `where you're so so present that you are never stressed.`],
    ['01:09', `I do believe that it is possible to live life more stress-free and more worry-free.`],
    ['01:15', `Don't believe that stress is unavoidable, because it is avoidable.`],
    ['01:21', `So today I'm going to share some tips on how to deal with stress`],
    ['01:25', `and how to prevent you from being too overwhelmed by stress.`],
    ['01:29', `My first tip when you're feeling stressed is to 1) Take a shower or a bath.`],
    ['01:33', `There's something about cleansing yourself physically that also cleanses yourself mentally.`],
    ['01:38', `It also cleanses your energy, just washing away all those impurities.`],
    ['01:42', `It relaxes you instantly.`],
    ['01:45', `Also take time to hydrate and drink lots of water after that shower or bath,`],
    ['01:49', `and you'll feel so much better already.`],
    ['01:51', `My second tip is the biggest one: 2) Be present.`],
    ['01:55', `You notice that, when you're stressed, you're usually feeling worried or anxious`],
    ['01:59', `about the future because it's uncertain.`],
    ['02:01', `You're unsure whether you're gonna pass this test,`],
    ['02:04', `or you're not sure whether something's going to be certain,`],
    ['02:08', `and that can drive us crazy if we allow it to.`],
    ['02:11', `But when you're present, you're focused on whatever's in front of you.`],
    ['02:15', `And if you haven't noticed: You can always, always handle the present moment in front of you.`],
    ['02:20', `So whatever challenge is happening in your life,`],
    ['02:23', `if it's the situation you're in right now-right now, you'll deal with it.`],
    ['02:28', `But usually we're stressed because we're trying to deal with the situation that has not happened yet.`],
    ['02:34', `It's in the future.`],
    ['02:35', `That's what's causing the stress.`],
    ['02:36', `Know that your power is here, in the present moment.`],
    ['02:40', `You can think of a time when you maybe had a huge test in school coming up`],
    ['02:45', `and you were really stressed about it.`],
    ['02:46', `You were really stressed out studying or preparing,`],
    ['02:49', `or maybe procrastinating made you really stressed out.`],
    ['02:53', `But when you're actually there taking the test, you're not stressing out.`],
    ['02:57', `You're focused, you're flowing.`],
    ['02:58', `You're like, "Okay, let me figure this out. Let me do this…"`],
    ['03:02', `You're solving the problem in front of you.`],
    ['03:04', `Stress is a trick your mind plays on you before anything is actually happening.`],
    ['03:09', `Stress is the anticipation, not the action.`],
    ['03:13', `So focus on the action in the present moment and you'll be fine.`],
    ['03:17', `My third tip is to 3) brain dump.`],
    ['03:20', `Journal it all out.`],
    ['03:22', `When you journal out all your thoughts, worries, anxieties, you see what's causing your stress`],
    ['03:27', `and you see how irrational some of your fears or worries might be.`],
    ['03:32', `This might help you feel more clear afterwards, so that you're not in your head all the time.`],
    ['03:38', `Once you see it down on paper, you'll be able to organize your thoughts a little bit.`],
    ['03:42', `You might even give yourself advice in your journal session.`],
    ['03:45', `Usually I just help myself when I'm journaling it out.`],
    ['03:49', `"I'm worried about this. But also: this, this, and this. It's okay because this, this, and this."`],
    ['03:54', `So you can really use journaling as a tool to relieve your stress, to tell yourself –`],
    ['04:00', `remind yourself – that it's going to be okay.`],
    ['04:03', `You can also use this journaling session to help you plan out those next steps`],
    ['04:07', `to help you get out of this stressed situation.`],
    ['04:09', `You can use it as a productive time to get organized, plan your next baby steps,`],
    ['04:15', `see what beliefs or thoughts are holding you back.`],
    ['04:19', `Really use it to get clear.`],
    ['04:21', `The fourth step if you're a super stressed or super anxious person is to`],
    ['04:24', `4) Talk to someone and get help.`],
    ['04:27', `Sometimes you need an outsider's perspective to be able to see your situation clearly.`],
    ['04:31', `So talking to a trusted friend or therapist can really help you relieve your stress and anxiety`],
    ['04:37', `and put you at ease and feel at peace a little more.`],
    ['04:40', `An amazing resource to get connected with a licensed therapist online is BetterHelp.`],
    ['04:45', `I'm really grateful to have BetterHelp sponsor today's video.`],
    ['04:48', `BetterHelp is a platform for affordable, private, online counseling.`],
    ['04:52', `Their website and app offers access to licensed, trained and accredited counselors and therapists,`],
    ['04:57', `straight from your home, so that anyone who's struggling can get help anytime, anywhere.`],
    ['05:02', `How it works is: You fill out a survey and they match you with a counselor who's perfect for you.`],
    ['05:07', `You'll be able to see a description of your therapist, his/her specialties,`],
    ['05:10', `years of experience, and reviews from other clients too.`],
    ['05:13', `You can always switch with the therapist if you don't vibe with the one you got matched with.`],
    ['05:17', `So after sharing a little bit about myself and my situation,`],
    ['05:19', `BetterHelp matched me with a therapist in a day and we scheduled a live video chat.`],
    ['05:24', `So that was actually my first experience with talking to a therapist.`],
    ['05:28', `And even in the first session, it was just refreshing to be able to share my problems`],
    ['05:34', `and anxieties honestly with someone who doesn't know who I am.`],
    ['05:38', `And I even cried a lot in the first session which I totally did not expect.`],
    ['05:41', `But it's just been very healing and a different experience to try out.`],
    ['05:45', `So if you're interested definitely check out BetterHelp because it's so easy and accessible to use.`],
    ['05:50', `You can learn more at the description down below.`],
    ['05:52', `Tip 5) Detach yourself from the outcome and trust the process.`],
    ['05:58', `Understand that, in life, there are things that you can control and things that you cannot control.`],
    ['06:04', `And it's worthless, it's a waste of time to focus and worry about things that are outside of your control.`],
    ['06:09', `So just focus on everything that you can control.`],
    ['06:12', `Basically, do your best and release your control of the outcome.`],
    ['06:16', `Consider having this new perspective: I don't mind what happens.`],
    ['06:21', `When you don't mind what happens, you are living more carefree, you have zero expectations.`],
    ['06:27', `Whatever happens, happens.`],
    ['06:28', `I actually have a previous video where I talked about that quote,`],
    ['06:32', `where I first heard about it, which I'll link down below.`],
    ['06:35', `The idea is that life will take you in these different directions.`],
    ['06:40', `You will have challenges and hard times, but everything given to you,`],
    ['06:44', `everything put in front of you in life is there to help you grow, to help you learn, to help you get stronger.`],
    ['06:51', `So just trust that whatever's in front of you is whatever you have to grow through,`],
    ['06:56', `whatever you have to face.`],
    ['06:58', `And an easy life is not real.`],
    ['07:00', `There's no easy life.`],
    ['07:01', `There's no perfect life.`],
    ['07:03', `Bad things are gonna happen.`],
    ['07:05', `Challenges are gonna happen.`],
    ['07:06', `So as long as you have the mindset of:`],
    ['07:09', `"I'm just gonna do my best and not care about the outcome. I'm here to learn,"`],
    ['07:13', `you'll be okay.`],
    ['07:15', `Tip 6) Meditate`],
    ['07:17', `I honestly would've put this earlier on in the steps but I feel like I say it so much`],
    ['07:21', `that I wonder if you guys are sick of it.`],
    ['07:24', `But meditation should be in every single video because it is one of the cornerstone habits,`],
    ['07:30', `one of the main tips of being more stress-free, carefree, happy in life.`],
    ['07:35', `It just has so many benefits.`],
    ['07:37', `If you could just meditate five minutes a day, you'll already feel the benefits of a more calm mind,`],
    ['07:44', `and a more centered soul, if you know what I mean.`],
    ['07:48', `Meditation is learning to realign with your soul and softening the noise around you,`],
    ['07:56', `and remembering that your soul within, it's always still, it's always strong.`],
    ['08:01', `Your soul is invincible.`],
    ['08:03', `So meditation is a reminder to come back to that and realize that everything around is just temporary.`],
    ['08:11', `It's not going to stay like that forever.`],
    ['08:13', `Anyway, if it's difficult for you to meditate,`],
    ['08:15', `you can definitely try guided meditations like Calm or Headspace.`],
    ['08:20', `Or you could try spa music.`],
    ['08:22', `I really like Spotify spa music in the background sometimes, just because it's so relaxing.`],
    ['08:28', `There's also a quote that I heard once that really stuck with me, something like:`],
    ['08:32', `"Fifteen minutes of meditation a day is essential.`],
    ['08:36', `If you are busy, then an hour is necessary."`],
    ['08:39', `I actually think that's a quote that keeps coming up in my meditation app Zenfriend.`],
    ['08:43', `But anyway, it's super true that you should meditate every day,`],
    ['08:48', `but if you are busier or if you are more stressed, then you should meditate longer.`],
    ['08:53', `I know it's counter – When you're busy, you're like, "I don't have time for meditation."`],
    ['08:57', `But when you're busy is when you need meditation the most.`],
    ['09:01', `The last tip for when you're feeling stressed is to 7) Take care of yourself.`],
    ['09:05', `Take care of your body, your health, your well-being.`],
    ['09:08', `Don't forget that self care always comes first,`],
    ['09:11', `because you have to be okay in order to function in everyday life.`],
    ['09:15', `So make sure you're eating healthy, drinking a lot of water, getting enough sleep.`],
    ['09:20', `It really is the basics.`],
    ['09:21', `And I know that when we're busy or stressed, we tend to sacrifice things like that.`],
    ['09:25', `We tend to cut sleep, we tend to eat unhealthy because it's more convenient.`],
    ['09:30', `But when you're busy, that's actually the time that you need those things more.`],
    ['09:35', `The busier you are, the more you own it to yourself to take care of yourself.`],
    ['09:40', `Lastly, I want to leave you guys with a quote that I really like.`],
    ['09:43', `It's by Dale Carnegie:`],
    ['09:45', `"Inaction breeds doubt and fear.`],
    ['09:48', `Action breeds confidence and courage.`],
    ['09:51', `If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it.`],
    ['09:55', `Go out and get busy."`],
    ['09:57', `That just means that, when you're feeling stressed, anxious, worried,`],
    ['09:59', `which are all versions of fear, it means that it's all happening in your head.`],
    ['10:04', `And the best thing that you can do to get out of that state is to simply take action.`],
    ['10:10', `Similar to my point of being present, focus on what you can do right now`],
    ['10:15', `in the present moment, and do your best.`],
    ['10:18', `That's the best that you can do.`],
    ['10:20', `And when you start to take action, you will feel like – the fear dissolves`],
    ['10:25', `because you're so focused on what you're doing.`],
    ['10:28', `So when you just sit home and you're just thinking, of course you're gonna feel stressed and scared, all of this.`],
    ['10:33', `But when you're taking action, you feel more confident and you have more courage`],
    ['10:38', `and bravery to keep going and to just get things done.`],
    ['10:41', `So I send you guys all of that positive energy, all of that just-do-it energy.`],
    ['10:47', `And I hope that whatever stress you're going through right now,`],
    ['10:51', `that you just take a step back from your life,`],
    ['10:54', `appreciate it for what it is, be grateful for everything that you have, and just relax.`],
    ['10:59', `Appreciate the beauty, and after you do that, focus on what's in front of you and get to work.`],
    ['11:05', `Alright, love you all so so much.`],
    ['11:07', `Make sure you check out BetterHelp down below.`],
    ['11:09', `And I will see you guys in the next one.`],
    ['11:11', `Bye!`],
