    ['00:06', `Hey guys!`],
    ['00:06', `Welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:08', `This video is on the five steps to undo your insecurities and negative self talk.`],
    ['00:13', `It's actually part 2 of the self worth and self esteem video that I recently uploaded.`],
    ['00:18', `So if you haven't watched that, go ahead and click on the card or down below.`],
    ['00:22', `Just keep in mind that I recorded it at the same time.`],
    ['00:25', `It was supposed to be part of the same video, but the video turned out to be so long.`],
    ['00:30', `I was like, "Oh my god, no one's going to watch this."`],
    ['00:31', `So I decided to break it down so that it's more digestible.`],
    ['00:35', `This one's going to stand on its own, but just keep that in mind.`],
    ['00:39', `Alright, hope you enjoy this one!`],
    ['00:40', `Now, let's talk about insecurities and how to undo your insecurities.`],
    ['00:46', `And this is a five-step process.`],
    ['00:49', `I know when I put it in five steps, it seems easy but it's really not that easy.`],
    ['00:53', `It's an ongoing five steps, but it hopefully will be helpful.`],
    ['00:58', `The first step is to become aware of your insecurities,`],
    ['01:01', `and you want to work through them one at a time.`],
    ['01:04', `You can't just knock out all your insecurities in life at once.`],
    ['01:07', `It really is one at a time.`],
    ['01:09', `In a journal, write down what the insecurity is,`],
    ['01:13', `and then ask yourself: "Where do I think this insecurity comes from?"`],
    ['01:17', `Where is the life experience, the deeply rooted childhood traumas that this insecurity comes from?`],
    ['01:23', `What do I believe is hurting me?`],
    ['01:26', `Look at your insecurities – and this is not always easy.`],
    ['01:29', `You've got to face your insecurities.`],
    ['01:31', `Cry if you have to.`],
    ['01:32', `FEEL it.`],
    ['01:33', `Don't just avoid it.`],
    ['01:34', `Most people just push down their insecurities because they're too afraid to feel it.`],
    ['01:38', `They don't want to feel that sadness, all of that.`],
    ['01:42', `So be brave enough to feel it, to face it, and analyze it: where does it come from?`],
    ['01:48', `That's Step 1.`],
    ['01:49', `Step 2: Change your perspective.`],
    ['01:52', `Ask yourself: "Am I willing to see this differently?"`],
    ['01:56', `The book, A Return to Love, says, "A miracle is just a shift in perception."`],
    ['02:00', `Sometimes all you have to do is change the way that you look at your life.`],
    ['02:04', `Change the way that you look at your insecurities.`],
    ['02:07', `Ask yourself: Am I willing to see this insecurity through the eyes of love?`],
    ['02:12', `Am I willing to see myself and treat myself with love?`],
    ['02:17', `You can't just sit and think about it.`],
    ['02:18', `I want you to really journal it out and put it on paper.`],
    ['02:22', `What would it look like if you treated yourself with love, regarding this insecurity?`],
    ['02:27', `How would you deal with this insecurity with love?`],
    ['02:30', `A part of that might be going back to that experience where that insecurity came from,`],
    ['02:37', `and seeing that experience through the eyes of love, rather than the eyes of "I'm not enough".`],
    ['02:42', `Say you're insecure about your thighs because in school,`],
    ['02:46', `all the kids commented on your tree trunk thighs.`],
    ['02:50', `And that is a common insecurity that women have.`],
    ['02:53', `Instead of seeing yourself as just the victim being bullied and then feeling like you're not pretty enough,`],
    ['03:00', `you're not good enough, you look at that situation through the eyes of love.`],
    ['03:05', `Then you would see that what you would do to that child version of you is give yourself a big hug`],
    ['03:10', `and tell yourself she's beautiful and it's okay,`],
    ['03:13', `and it doesn't matter what other people say about her.`],
    ['03:15', `They don't know what they're saying.`],
    ['03:16', `They're kids.`],
    ['03:17', `They will forget that they said that the next day.`],
    ['03:19', `In ten years, it won't matter.`],
    ['03:21', `Basically, you have to look at this insecurity and these life experiences from all angles.`],
    ['03:25', `Try to shift it.`],
    ['03:27', `Try to see it from a new perspective, and treat all of those perspectives with love.`],
    ['03:32', `The third step is to reprogram your mind with thoughts that support you,`],
    ['03:37', `thoughts that are made out of love, that support you, that are positive,`],
    ['03:42', `that will not hold you down or put you down any longer, because that's all that insecurity does.`],
    ['03:47', `For each insecure and negative thought that you have –`],
    ['03:49', `hopefully you're writing them out line-by-line, working on them each individually –`],
    ['03:54', `I want you to cross out the insecurity and rewrite it with a new belief that supports you,`],
    ['04:01', `a new belief that's written out of love.`],
    ['04:02', `For example, you might write: "I'm insecure about my thighs and I tend to hide them`],
    ['04:06', `because I'm afraid to show them to the world."`],
    ['04:09', `You would cross that out and instead you would write a new belief:`],
    ['04:12', `"I love my body because my body is strong and I'm capable of walking and running`],
    ['04:18', `and doing all of these amazing things with my body.`],
    ['04:19', `I do not need the beauty standards made up by mainstream media`],
    ['04:23', `to dictate how I feel about my own body."`],
    ['04:26', `The process is: After you've become aware of your insecurities or your negative thoughts,`],
    ['04:31', `you refute those thoughts and instead write a new thought that supports it.`],
    ['04:35', `After doing this exercise with a bunch of insecurities,`],
    ['04:38', `you will have a list of positive affirmations, positive self talk.`],
    ['04:43', `And the way to ingrain those into your mind is pure repetition.`],
    ['04:47', `Write these in your phone, repeat them to yourself in the morning, in the evening.`],
    ['04:52', `Repetition is how you brainwash yourself to really, really believe in it.`],
    ['04:56', `And this is brainwash for good, for positivity.`],
    ['04:59', `You want to reprogram your mind to stop thinking about those negative, insecure thoughts`],
    ['05:04', `and instead replace those thoughts with these positive ones.`],
    ['05:07', `The fourth step to undo your insecurities is to stop comparing yourself to other people.`],
    ['05:12', `You have to change your mindset and see that it's not a competition, it's about community.`],
    ['05:18', `We are here on this earth to work together in community.`],
    ['05:22', `You're not in competition with all the girls you see on Instagram.`],
    ['05:25', `It's not a race.`],
    ['05:26', `You're not trying to be better than other people.`],
    ['05:29', `There is no way that you can be better than other people because everyone's story is different.`],
    ['05:34', `Each person has their own life experience, their own strengths, their own stories.`],
    ['05:38', `And there's no way you can compare one person with the person next to each other.`],
    ['05:42', `They might be good at different things and different areas.`],
    ['05:47', `It's not an equal comparison.`],
    ['05:49', `It's not a fair comparison, so just stop comparing yourself to other people.`],
    ['05:54', `Know that all you need to compare yourself to is the past you, the you from last year, five years ago.`],
    ['06:01', `As long as you are improving, then that's all that matters.`],
    ['06:04', `It's progress, not perfection.`],
    ['06:07', `Progress, not competition.`],
    ['06:10', `One thing that I had to learn too, in my life is:`],
    ['06:13', `One person's success does not diminish your own worth.`],
    ['06:18', `Just because someone else is beautiful and killing it in life doesn't make you any less.`],
    ['06:22', `It just shows that you can do that too.`],
    ['06:25', `And what we should do instead is lift each other up, rather than want each other to fail.`],
    ['06:31', `One person's light does not diminish your own light.`],
    ['06:33', `If anything, it can help you find the light you have within, to bring it out even more.`],
    ['06:39', `Lastly, Step #5 is to stay aware and just catch yourself whenever you notice yourself`],
    ['06:45', `having an insecure or negative thought, or when you catch yourself`],
    ['06:49', `comparing yourself to other people, because you know that those things hurt you.`],
    ['06:55', `You want to program your mind to only think thoughts that help you and support you in your life.`],
    ['07:02', `You gotta be policing your mind and your thoughts sometimes.`],
    ['07:05', `You are in control of your mind.`],
    ['07:07', `And you don't want to let your mind control you`],
    ['07:09', `because most people let their mind and thoughts control them.`],
    ['07:12', `But know that you can take the power back.`],
    ['07:15', `So Step #5 is just to stay consciously aware of your mind and actively practice those positive affirmations,`],
    ['07:23', `programming your mind for positive thinking, seeing the world through the perspective of love.`],
    ['07:30', `And if you keep doing these things, it's a continuous positive feedback loop,`],
    ['07:35', `and it will help you so much with undoing your insecurities.`],
    ['07:38', `Stay tuned for more videos in this self worth mini-series.`],
    ['07:42', `Make sure you catch the previous video if you haven't seen it already.`],
    ['07:44', `Love you guys so much.`],
    ['07:46', `Bye!`],
