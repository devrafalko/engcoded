    ['00:00', `This episode of Real Engineering is brought to you by Brilliant.`],
    ['00:03', `A problem solving website that teaches you to think like an engineer.`],
    ['00:08', `Last month Tesla held an event for their investors revealing the advances they had made in their`],
    ['00:12', `autonomous driving capabilities.`],
    ['00:14', `Currently, most Tesla vehicles are capable of enhancing the driver's abilities.`],
    ['00:19', `It can take over the tedious task of maintaining lanes on highways , monitor and match the`],
    ['00:24', `speeds of surrounding vehicles and can even be summoned to you while you aren’t in the`],
    ['00:28', `vehicle.`],
    ['00:30', `Those capabilities are impressive and in some cases even life-saving, but it is still a`],
    ['00:35', `far reach from a full self-driving vehicle.`],
    ['00:38', `Requiring regular input from the driver to ensure they are paying attention and capable`],
    ['00:42', `of taking over when needed.`],
    ['00:44', `There are 3 primary challenges automakers like Tesla, need to overcome in order to succeed`],
    ['00:50', `in replacing the human driver.`],
    ['00:52', `The first of those is building a safe system`],
    ['00:55', `In order to replace human drivers, the self-driving car needs to be safer than a human driver.`],
    ['01:00', `So how do we quantify that?`],
    ['01:03', `We can’t guarantee accidents won’t occur.`],
    ['01:05', `Old Murphy’s Law is always in play.`],
    ['01:08', `We can start by quantifying how safe human drivers are.`],
    ['01:12', `In the US, the current fatality rate is about one death per one million hours of driving.`],
    ['01:18', `That includes humans being stupid and crashing while drunk or looking at their phone, so`],
    ['01:22', `we can probably hold our vehicles to a higher standard.`],
    ['01:25', `But that can be our benchmark for now, our self-driving vehicle needs to fail less than`],
    ['01:30', `once every one million hours, and currently, that is not the case.`],
    ['01:34', `[1]`],
    ['01:35', `We do not have enough data to calculate an accurate statistic here, but we do know that`],
    ['01:40', `Uber’s self driving vehicle needed a human to intervene around every 19 kilometres s,`],
    ['01:45', `meaning it failed every 13 miles.`],
    ['01:48', `[13] Which makes Ubers collision with a pedestrian who unfortunately passed away, even more shocking.`],
    ['01:54', `Supporters of self-driving vehicles were quick to blame the pedestrian for stepping in front`],
    ['01:58', `of the vehicle in low light conditions [2], but we cannot let our desire to advance the`],
    ['02:02', `technology to make excuses for it.`],
    ['02:05', `The vehicle was using lidar sensors which do not need light to see.`],
    ['02:09', `Yet, it made no attempt to slow down even after the human occupant, who was not paying`],
    ['02:15', `attention, had noticed the imminent crash.`],
    ['02:18', `According to data obtained from Uber, the vehicle first observed the pedestrian 6 seconds`],
    ['02:23', `before impact with its radar and lidar sensors.`],
    ['02:27', `At this point it was travelling at 70 kilometres per hour [3].`],
    ['02:30', `It continued at this speed.`],
    ['02:32', `As the pedestrian and vehicles paths converged the computers classifying system is seen struggling`],
    ['02:37', `to identify what the object in its view is.`],
    ['02:41', `Jumping from unidentified object to car, to cyclist.`],
    ['02:44', `With no certainty in the trajectory path of the object.`],
    ['02:48', `1.3 seconds before the crash the vehicle recognised it needed to perform an emergency brake, but`],
    ['02:54', `didn’t as it was programmed not to break if the would result in a deceleration over`],
    ['02:58', `6.5 metres per second squared.`],
    ['03:01', `Instead, the human operator is expected to intervene, but the vehicle was not designed`],
    ['03:06', `to alert the driver.`],
    ['03:08', `A shocking design considering our earlier statistic.`],
    ['03:11', `The driver did intervene a second before impact by engaging the steering wheel and breaking,`],
    ['03:17', `bringing the vehicle speed to 62 kilometres per hour.`],
    ['03:20', `Too little and too late to save this person.`],
    ['03:23', `Nothing on the vehicle malfunctioned.`],
    ['03:26', `Everything worked as programmed, it was simply poor programming.`],
    ['03:29', `Here the internal computer was clearly not programmed to deal with uncertainty.`],
    ['03:34', `Where a human would likely slow down when confronted with something on the road that`],
    ['03:38', `it could not clearly identify, this programme simply continued on until it could identify`],
    ['03:43', `the threat, at which point it was too late.`],
    ['03:46', `It struggled to identify the object and predict it’s path even with high resolution lidar.`],
    ['03:52', `So how can we improve safety?`],
    ['03:54', `A large part of that lies in the hardware itself and the programming that goes into`],
    ['03:58', `it.`],
    ['03:59', `Tesla unveiled its new purpose-built computer, a chip specifically optimized for running`],
    ['04:04', `a neural network, which Elon stated was the first of its kind.`],
    ['04:08', `[https://youtu.be/Ucp0TTmvqOE?t=6031]`],
    ['04:09', `It has been designed to be retrofitted into existing vehicle s when customers purchase`],
    ['04:13', `the full self-driving upgrade.`],
    ['04:15', `So is a similar size and draws the same power as the existing self- driving computers at`],
    ['04:20', `100 Watts [4]`],
    ['04:22', `This has increased Tesla’s self driving computer’s capabilities by 2100%.`],
    ['04:28', `Allowing it to process 2300 frames per second, 2190 frames more than their previous iteration.`],
    ['04:36', `A massive performance jump, and that processing power will be needed to analyse footage from`],
    ['04:42', `the suite of sensors each new Tesla has.`],
    ['04:45', `On the right side of the board are all connectors for the different sensors and cameras in the`],
    ['04:49', `car.`],
    ['04:50', `That currently consists of 3 forward facing cameras, all mounted behind the windshield.`],
    ['04:55', `One is a 120-degree wide angle fisheye lens, which gives situational awareness.`],
    ['05:01', `Capturing traffic lights and objects moving into the path of travel.`],
    ['05:05', `The second camera is a narrow-angle lens which provides longer range information needed for`],
    ['05:10', `high speed driving like on a motorway, and the third is the main camera, which sits in`],
    ['05:14', `the middle between these two applications.`],
    ['05:17', `There are 4 additional cameras on the sides of the vehicle which check for vehicles unexpectedly`],
    ['05:22', `entering your lane and provide the information needed to safely enter intersections and change`],
    ['05:28', `lane.`],
    ['05:29', `The 8th and final camera is located to the rear, which doubles as a parking camera, but`],
    ['05:33', `has also saved more than a few teslas from being rear-ended.`],
    ['05:36', `*cut to footage of Tesla speeding up autonomously to avoid a crash*`],
    ['05:37', `The vehicle does not completely rely on visual cameras.`],
    ['05:41', `It also makes use of 12 ultrasonic sensors which provide a 360-degree picture of the`],
    ['05:46', `immediate area around the vehicle, and 1 forward facing radar.`],
    ['05:51', `[5]`],
    ['05:52', `Finding the correct sensor fusion has been a subject of debate among competing self-driving`],
    ['05:56', `companies.`],
    ['05:57', `Musk recently stated that anyone relying on Lidar sensors, which works similarly to radar`],
    ['06:02', `but utilizes light instead of radio waves, is doomed and that it’s a fool’s errand.`],
    ['06:08', `To see why he said this let’s plot the strengths of each sensor on a radar chart like this,`],
    ['06:13', `where we rank each feature on a scale of zero to five, five being the best and zero being`],
    ['06:19', `non-existent.`],
    ['06:20', `Lidar would look something like this.`],
    ['06:22', `[6] It’s got great resolution, meaning it provides high detail information on what it’s`],
    ['06:27', `detecting.`],
    ['06:28', `Works in the low and high light situations, is capable of measuring speed, has good range,`],
    ['06:33', `and works moderately well in poor weather conditions.`],
    ['06:37', `Its biggest weakness however is why Musk slated it.`],
    ['06:40', `The sensors are expensive and bulky.`],
    ['06:43', `And this is where the second challenge of building a self-driving car comes into play.`],
    ['06:48', `Building an affordable system that the average person will be willing to buy.`],
    ['06:52', `Lidar sensors are those big sensors you see on Waymo, Uber and most competing self-driving`],
    ['06:57', `tech.`],
    ['06:58', `Musk is more than aware of Lidars potential, after all Space X utilizes it in their dragon`],
    ['07:05', `eye navigation sensor.[9] It’s weaknesses are simply too much of a sticking point for`],
    ['07:09', `Tesla for now, who are focused on building not just a cost-effective vehicle, but a good`],
    ['07:15', `looking vehicle.`],
    ['07:16', `Lidar technology is gradually becoming smaller and cheaper.`],
    ['07:20', `Making the technology more accessible, but far from cheap.`],
    ['07:23', `Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, sells its lidar sensors to any company`],
    ['07:29', `that does not compete with its plans for a self-driving taxi service.`],
    ['07:34', `When they started in 2009 the per unit cost of a Lidar sensor was around seventy-five`],
    ['07:39', `thousand dollars, but they have managed to reduce that cost to seventy-five hundred dollars`],
    ['07:45', `in the past ten years by manufacturing the units themselves.`],
    ['07:48', `[7] From what I can tell.`],
    ['07:50', `Waymo vehicles use 4 lidar sensors on each side of the vehicle.`],
    ['07:54', `Placing the total cost for just these sensors, for a third party, at thirty thousand dollars.`],
    ['07:59', `Not far off the total cost of a base model Model 3.`],
    ['08:03', `This sort of pricing clearly doesn’t line up with Tesla’s mission “To accelerate`],
    ['08:07', `the world’s transition to sustainable transport”.`],
    ['08:10', `[8]`],
    ['08:11', `This issue has pushed Tesla towards a cheaper sensor fusion set up.`],
    ['08:14', `Let’s look at the strengths and weakness of the 3 other sensor types to see how Tesla`],
    ['08:19', `is making do without lidar.`],
    ['08:21', `First, let's look at radar.`],
    ['08:23', `This is the radar sensor on the Tesla Model 3.`],
    ['08:24', `Radar works wonderfully in all conditions.`],
    ['08:26', `The sensors are small and cheap, capable of detecting speed, and its range is good for`],
    ['08:31', `both short and long distance detection.`],
    ['08:34', `Where they fall is the low-resolution data they provide, but this weakness can easily`],
    ['08:38', `be augmented by combining it with cameras.`],
    ['08:42', `Regular video cameras look like this on our radar chart.`],
    ['08:45', `Having excellent range and resolution, provide colour and contrast information for reading`],
    ['08:50', `street signs, and are extremely small and cheap.`],
    ['08:53', `Combining radar and cameras allows each to cover the weakness of the other.`],
    ['08:58', `We are still a little weak in proximity detection, but using two cameras in stereo can allow`],
    ['09:02', `the cameras to work like our eyes to estimate distance.`],
    ['09:06', `When fine tuned distance measurement is needed we can use our our ultrasonic sensors, which`],
    ['09:10', `are these little circular sensors dotted around the car.`],
    ['09:14', `This gives us solid performance all around without relying on large and expensive sensors,`],
    ['09:19', `but Tesla is suffering from a bit of a redundancy problem with only one forward facing radar.`],
    ['09:25', `If that fails there isn’t a second radar sensor to rely upon.`],
    ['09:28', `This is a cost effective solution, and according to Tesla their hardware is already capable`],
    ['09:34', `of allowing their vehicles to self-drive.`],
    ['09:36', `Now they just need to continue improving on the software and Tesla is in a fantastic position`],
    ['09:41', `to make it work.`],
    ['09:43', `When training a neural network data is key.`],
    ['09:46', `Waymo has millions of kilometres driven to gain data, but Tesla has over a billion.`],
    ['09:51', `33% of all driving with Teslas is with autopilot engaged.`],
    ['09:52', `This data also extends past just while autopilot is engaged.`],
    ['09:56', `It also receives data in areas where autopilot is not available, like city streets.`],
    ['10:01', `Accounting for all the unpredictability of driving requires an immense amount of training`],
    ['10:06', `for a machine learning algorithm, and this is where Tesla’s data gives them an advantage.`],
    ['10:11', `I won’t go through the intricacies of training a neural network again, as I have covered`],
    ['10:15', `it in the past in my machine learning versus cancer video, but the key take away you need`],
    ['10:20', `is that the more data you have to train a neural network, the better it’s going to`],
    ['10:25', `be.`],
    ['10:26', `Tesla’s machine vision does a decent job of it, but there are plenty of gaps in their`],
    ['10:30', `abilities.`],
    ['10:31', `A channel here on YouTube by the name of “Greentheonly” has managed to hack into his Tesla’s vision`],
    ['10:36', `to show us what the software actually sees.`],
    ['10:40', `Here we can see that the software places bounding boxes around objects it detects, while categorising`],
    ['10:45', `them as cars, trucks, bicycles and pedestrians.`],
    ['10:48', `It labels each with a relative velocity to the vehicle and what lane is occupies.`],
    ['10:53', `It highlights drivable areas, marks the lane dividers and sets a projected path between`],
    ['10:58', `them.`],
    ['10:59', `For now this data allows autopilot to operate on highways, but it frequently struggles with`],
    ['11:04', `more complicated scenes.`],
    ['11:06', `Here a pedestrian is not detected.`],
    ['11:08', `Here it struggles to tell if a roller skater is a bike or a pedestrian, and here it drives`],
    ['11:12', `onto the wrong side of the road when there is a gap in lane dividers.[12]`],
    ['11:17', `Tesla of course is more than aware of these problems, and is gradually improving on it’s`],
    ['11:22', `software through firmware updates.`],
    ['11:24', `Adding functionality like stop line recognition.`],
    ['11:27', `And this latest self driving computer is going to radically increase the computer's processing`],
    ['11:31', `power.`],
    ['11:32', `Which allow Tesla to continue adding functionality without jeopardising refresh rates of information.`],
    ['11:38', `But even if they manage to develop the perfect computer vision, programming the vehicle on`],
    ['11:42', `how to handle every scenario is another hurdle.`],
    ['11:46', `This is a vital part of building not only a safe vehicle, but a practical self -driving`],
    ['11:51', `vehicle.`],
    ['11:52', `Which is our third challenge.`],
    ['11:54', `Programming for safety and practicality often conflict with each other.`],
    ['11:58', `Take the AI program Dr. Tom Murphy developed to do something relatively simple.`],
    ['12:03', `To play Tetris.`],
    ['12:04', `[10] This program worked brilliantly, but Tetris`],
    ['12:07', `always wins.`],
    ['12:08', `The game is unbeatable, and you will eventually lose.`],
    ['12:11', `When confronted with this option the program did something to ensure it wouldn’t lose.`],
    ['12:16', `It paused the game.`],
    ['12:18', `If we program a vehicle purely for safety.`],
    ['12:20', `It’s safest option is to not drive.`],
    ['12:23', `Driving is an inherently dangerous operation, and programming for the multitude of scenarios`],
    ['12:28', `that can arise while driving is an insanely difficult task.`],
    ['12:32', `It’s easy to say “Follow the rules of the road and you will do fine”, but the`],
    ['12:35', `problem is, humans don’t follow the rules of the road perfectly.`],
    ['12:40', `Take a simple four way stop as an example.`],
    ['12:42', `The rules of the road make this seem like an easy task.`],
    ['12:46', `The first person to arrive at the intersection has the right of way, and in the case that`],
    ['12:50', `two vehicles arrive at the same time.`],
    ['12:53', `The vehicle to the right has the right of way.`],
    ['12:55', `The problem is, no human follows these rules.`],
    ['12:58', `When Google began testing their driverless cars in 2009 this was just one of the issues`],
    ['13:03', `they ran into.`],
    ['13:04', `[11] When it arrived at one of these 4 way junctions humans kept nudging forward trying`],
    ['13:09', `to make their way onto the junction before their turn.`],
    ['13:12', `The Google car was programmed to follow the letter of the law, and just like our Tetris`],
    ['13:16', `program from earlier, the self-driving vehicle was put in a no-win scenario and stuck on`],
    ['13:21', `pause.`],
    ['13:23', `Scenarios like this pop up everywhere and requires programmers to break the letter of`],
    ['13:27', `the law and be a little aggressive.`],
    ['13:29', `Sometimes the computer will need to make difficult decisions, and may at times need make a decision`],
    ['13:35', `that endangers the life of its occupants or people outside of the vehicle.`],
    ['13:39', `That is just a natural byproduct of an inherently dangerous task, but if we continue improving`],
    ['13:45', `on the technology we could start to see road deaths plummet, while making taxi services`],
    ['13:50', `drastically cheaper and freeing many people from the financial burden of purchasing a`],
    ['13:55', `vehicle.`],
    ['13:56', `Tesla is in a fantastic position to gradually update their software as they master each`],
    ['14:01', `scenario.`],
    ['14:02', `They don’t need to create the perfect self-driving car out of the gate, and with this latest`],
    ['14:06', `computer they are going to be able to continue improving their technology.`],
    ['14:11', `This is the fantastic thing about software.`],
    ['14:13', `It is easily updatable, and Brilliant have improved their software by allowing courses`],
