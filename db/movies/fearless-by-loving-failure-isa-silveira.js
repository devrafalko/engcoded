    ['03:13', `just can't shit tons of theory and`],
    ['03:15', `that's it and then I I started doing`],
    ['03:18', `back in development and I was fine like`],
    ['03:20', `doing job okay right fuck but then I`],
    ['03:23', `just start really getting into the whole`],
    ['03:26', `like via layer and stuff and I mean at`],
    ['03:31', `the beginning it really felt like people`],
    ['03:34', `had room to innovate yeah and then when`],

    ['04:05', `of doing development some of the told`],
    ['04:07', `stories about how it was like in the`],
    ['04:10', `early days of Silicon Valley because at`],
    ['04:13', `that time there was no such thing as`],
    ['04:15', `studying computer science a was it was`],
    ['04:19', `basically as people that the people had`],
    ['04:21', `gone into it were`],
    ['04:22', `six majors yeah yeah I'm math people`],
    ['04:24', `yeah so everybody was just like how do`],
    ['04:27', `we do this I've got do all kinds of`],
    ['04:29', `weird shit so there was so much`],
    ['04:31', `innovation going on going on around that`],
    ['04:33', `time it's just ludicrous how much of the`],
    ['04:37', `things that we do today was invented`],
    ['04:39', `back then and it's same thing like with`],
    ['04:42', `react and stuff just people like finding`],
    ['04:46', `some old paper and then they do a`],

    ['04:55', `fucking try to fit into boxes when it`],
    ['04:57', `can be so much more and I think it's`],
    ['05:00', `really funny because I'll have people`],
    ['05:01', `talk about functional programming like`],
    ['05:03', `it's a cooler shit but that shouldn't`],
    ['05:04', `dance ever since like 1950s so do you`],
    ['05:07', `the second crowd yeah but the thing is`],
    ['05:09', `that there was no Messiah like`],
    ['05:10', `presenting functional programming as a`],
    ['05:12', `choice our field is very very new if you`],
    ['05:16', `think about it but at the same time`],
    ['05:17', `there's just so many stuff that people`],
    ['05:19', `already did before and people just`],
    ['05:20', `forget it was oh we have this very cool`],
    ['05:22', `model that been - fits into our problems`],
    ['05:25', `and that that's what I'm a little bit`],
    ['05:29', `frustrating about that I wrote some`],
    ['05:39', `questions over there but they haven't`],
    ['05:40', `synced hang on I music especially like`],
    ['05:50', `we are reuse David it's okay to breathe`],
    ['05:52', `it's hard can I do you want me to do`],
    ['05:57', `this for you I really didn't need more`],
    ['06:00', `than idea so it feels like it doesn't`],
    ['06:03', `really it's really needed with you but I`],
    ['06:06', `figure like I want to start with a`],
    ['06:08', `warm-up question basically I figured`],
    ['06:10', `that all the people like the interviewee`],
    ['06:12', `needs to be start they start talking so`],
    ['06:15', `I want to ask like what is what is a`],
    ['06:18', `typical workday yeah it's usually my`],
    ['06:20', `work day is it really depends on a`],
    ['06:22', `project because there's a where I work`],
    ['06:25', `at which is working Co we have an office`],
    ['06:27', `in New York some offices in the USA`],
    ['06:29', `some offices in Brazil so depending on`],
    ['06:31', `the project it means that I could be`],
    ['06:33', `working with people in a different`],
    ['06:35', `office so that means like the`],
    ['06:37', `interaction is almost like remote work`],
    ['06:39', `you just have to talk to people through`],
    ['06:41', `slack and stuff and like usually there's`],
    ['06:43', `a synchronicity to the whole`],
    ['06:46', `communication because you have to like`],
    ['06:48', `make sure that all the informations are`],
    ['06:50', `available in slack or either github or`],
    ['06:52', `Trello whatever so usually I just see`],
    ['06:56', `whatever it is because especially on the`],
    ['06:59', `first parts of the project we have to`],
    ['07:02', `make a lot of decisions in teams so like`],
    ['07:05', `you can't really this side so that that`],
    ['07:08', `is really complicated because you have`],
    ['07:10', `to really simulation conversation and`],
    ['07:12', `some people are in that use of that`],
    ['07:14', `especially because of the cultural`],
    ['07:16', `differences and that is very funny`],
    ['07:18', `because that's when you start feeling`],
    ['07:21', `like occasion I'd say this should I`],
    ['07:23', `propose this should I propose a solution`],
    ['07:24', `because do you have an example of of`],
    ['07:28', `that like a common cultural inertia`],
    ['07:34', `between your offices yeah totally it's`],
    ['07:37', `usually very vivid when we have`],
    ['07:40', `retrospectives like project`],
    ['07:43', `retrospective Brazilians are usually`],
    ['07:45', `very like straight to the point but they`],
    ['07:47', `also don't want to sort of hurt the`],
    ['07:48', `person so they go round and round and`],
    ['07:50', `round and round until they say what they`],
    ['07:52', `actually wanted to say which is like oh`],
    ['07:53', `I think you're great and blah blah but I`],
    ['07:56', `think you could get better at this thing`],
    ['07:57', `and as from Americans it's usually I`],
    ['08:01', `think you fucked up in this and this and`],
    ['08:03', `this is really very straight to the`],
    ['08:06', `point and back sort of cultural`],
    ['08:08', `differences usually like sometimes get`],
    ['08:11', `in the way it's not that big because at`],
    ['08:14', `some point in the company you just start`],
    ['08:16', `knowing the people but at some point it`],
    ['08:19', `really creates those awkward situations`],
    ['08:21', `where you don't know like is a person`],
    ['08:22', `have a personal problem with me or it's`],
    ['08:25', `just the opinion I did not know that`],
    ['08:27', `Brazilians were like that and there's`],
    ['08:29', `actually research on this that the ranks`],
    ['08:32', `differents cultures on this scale of`],
    ['08:34', `directness and I've read it in the`],
    ['08:37', `context of this plane crash with the`],
    ['08:40', `Korean Airlines I believe`],
    ['08:42', `and they have like this to the extreme`],
    ['08:46', `side there's so many layers of it you`],
    ['08:48', `can't really give like this oh yeah I`],
    ['08:51', `think you fucked up so it's in in a`],
    ['08:54', `crisis situation it's hard in Korean I`],
    ['08:58', `the formal read to say that oh we're`],
    ['09:01', `about to crash I think it's like yeah`],
    ['09:12', `electric crash I mean yeah that's that I`],
    ['09:15', `mean not to that point but with`],
    ['09:16', `Brazilians is sort of the same way like`],
    ['09:18', `you have to say at least five good`],
    ['09:20', `things about them before you get to that`],
    ['09:24', `it's usually very awkward because`],
    ['09:27', `whenever someone is not like this we`],
    ['09:29', `think it's a personal problem thank you`],
    ['09:30', `that's really awkward but it's it's fun`],
    ['09:33', `because that's really I really like to`],
    ['09:35', `be able to work somewhere a word and get`],
    ['09:37', `the interaction within people that`],
    ['09:39', `aren't from my environment because I`],
    ['09:42', `think it makes me more rich in a sense`],
    ['09:43', `like probably the person is gonna have`],
    ['09:46', `the different baggage and like even`],
    ['09:47', `technically the sort of resources that`],
    ['09:50', `you have to learn in America or the`],
    ['09:52', `countries aren't really not what we have`],
    ['09:54', `in Brazil so it's always nice like`],
    ['09:56', `switch and share and exchange stuff`],
    ['09:59', `think even culturally so but it`],
    ['10:02', `eventually creates those situations so`],
    ['10:04', `how did you get started in development`],
    ['10:08', `like from the first time like what what`],
    ['10:10', `what what what's the spark it was`],
    ['10:13', `actually funny because I never had a`],
    ['10:15', `dream of being an developer in the first`],
    ['10:16', `place it was all like sort of a certain`],
    ['10:19', `that pity because I didn't know what to`],
    ['10:21', `do I was back then and I was 13 and my`],
    ['10:23', `parents were struggling with money like`],
    ['10:26', `they the kids in Brazil you can have`],
    ['10:28', `either public education for like high`],
    ['10:30', `school or even university and you have`],
    ['10:32', `that it you can have the private one`],
    ['10:34', `usually the private ones a lot better`],
    ['10:35', `but it costs a lot and my parents were`],
    ['10:38', `struggling with money and there was a`],
    ['10:40', `school it was a federal institution for`],
    ['10:43', `high school and they also had all these`],
    ['10:45', `sort of technical courses and my mom was`],
    ['10:47', `just like well I think you should apply`],
    ['10:49', `like yeah and I was like at that phase`],
    ['10:51', `out I don't want it like I want to be`],
    ['10:53', `was`],
    ['10:53', `my friends and all along but I did take`],
    ['10:56', `the test and I passed and I had to`],
    ['10:58', `choose a course and there was like`],
    ['11:01', `several options but at this point you`],
    ['11:03', `haven't hadn't done on me know I dunno I`],
    ['11:05', `didn't even know what code was like I`],
    ['11:08', `chose informatics because like my`],
    ['11:10', `thinking at the time was oh I really`],
    ['11:12', `like computer it's like I like going`],
    ['11:14', `through the web and I had no idea what`],
    ['11:17', `the course was I thought it was gonna be`],
    ['11:18', `like computer maintenance or some sort`],
    ['11:20', `of that but it wasn't it was like very`],
    ['11:23', `deep dive into programming and I started`],
    ['11:26', `learning C but then I was 14 but I just`],
    ['11:29', `fell in love with it like it was a`],
    ['11:30', `completely dumb luck but I just fell in`],
    ['11:33', `love with it so I just continued after`],
    ['11:35', `the technical course after I graduated I`],
    ['11:37', `got into the University in Rio and but`],
    ['11:41', `later on I eventually quit and I started`],
    ['11:44', `to work with front-end development but I`],
    ['11:46', `before that I used to work a lot with`],
    ['11:48', `the becken which is how I started like`],
    ['11:51', `working that is what kept me going into`],
    ['11:54', `like developing projects I even worked`],
    ['11:56', `for research lab in Brazil also doing`],
    ['12:00', `stuff with machine learning NLP yeah`],
    ['12:03', `talk a little bit about that you started`],
    ['12:05', `out in research but at that time you had`],
    ['12:08', `dead have a software development`],
    ['12:10', `background and then he got into research`],
    ['12:12', `why why was that and why did you move`],
    ['12:15', `from that um actually I always liked to`],
    ['12:18', `the idea of doing something that's`],
    ['12:20', `practical because when you are in the`],
    ['12:22', `course like you're enrolled and of`],
    ['12:24', `course usually you have shit loads of`],
    ['12:25', `theory but you can never actually apply`],
    ['12:28', `that to anything and now I I always`],
    ['12:30', `wanted that like contact with someone`],
    ['12:31', `that I could actually experience and see`],
    ['12:33', `going back then in ufrj it was also a`],
    ['12:37', `really big University for research`],
    ['12:39', `because they have a very big research`],
    ['12:42', `lab it's really like respected Brazil so`],
    ['12:45', `I just thought like yeah I should try I`],
    ['12:46', `should try working there especially`],
    ['12:48', `because I I didn't even know which way`],
    ['12:51', `to program me I wanted to go so I`],
    ['12:53', `thought like yeah by diving deep into`],
    ['12:55', `research maybe I can figure that out a`],
    ['12:57', `little bit easier obviously it wasn't`],
    ['12:59', `the way it went I didn't kept in`],
    ['13:01', `research for for a long time but I think`],
    ['13:04', `it really opened my eyes`],
    ['13:05', `things like it because of that I'm more`],
    ['13:08', `familiar to some concepts that aren't`],
    ['13:10', `really from front-end developer`],
    ['13:12', `development but I can totally use that`],
    ['13:14', `in in my studies for machine learning`],
    ['13:17', `that I do about my own as a person that`],
    ['13:20', `has a background in like it's a proper`],
    ['13:25', `scientific background like with`],
    ['13:26', `empirical data and stuff what are things`],
    ['13:30', `that you feel like when you interact`],
    ['13:32', `with other front-end developers that`],
    ['13:34', `don't have that background what is there`],
    ['13:38', `some kind of repeating mistake that in`],
    ['13:40', `there like a hole in their thinking that`],
    ['13:43', `you observe yeah I see it a lot like I`],
    ['13:45', `see because when you start getting used`],
    ['13:48', `to research and like seeing that you`],
    ['13:50', `actually have to to make sure that your`],
    ['13:52', `assumption is right you have that like`],
    ['13:54', `the habit of being very sure through`],
    ['13:58', `data and through like experimentation if`],
    ['14:00', `what you're actually thinking is is`],
    ['14:02', `proving to be like true but in front-end`],
    ['14:05', `developer Anza and and also other areas`],
    ['14:08', `of computing I see people like having a`],
    ['14:10', `really strong assumption about something`],
    ['14:12', `not testing at all and just moving`],
    ['14:14', `forward with the solution which I think`],
    ['14:16', `like I really missed that like people`],
    ['14:20', `not being as attached to their own ideas`],
    ['14:23', `and their own experimentations because`],
    ['14:26', `it could be wrongly people usually don't`],
    ['14:28', `assume they could be wrong what I feel`],
    ['14:30', `like people that have worked a lot with`],
    ['14:32', `data and experimentation start shifting`],
    ['14:35', `their attitude a little bit towards the`],
    ['14:37', `concept of a idea rather than my idea or`],

    ['20:09', `doing oh it's fine man but a week why`],
    ['20:12', `didn't you share your experience like I`],
    ['20:14', `never see talks at conferences about`],

    ['20:21', `you don't talk about that I think you're`],
    ['20:23', `really hitting the spot there that it's`],
    ['20:25', `not to talk about failures is something`],
    ['20:28', `like when you have a something`],
    ['20:29', `successful you or you share it on`],
    ['20:31', `Instagram you share on Twitter you do a`],
    ['20:33', `talk about how successful like this`],
    ['20:35', `thing was but in reality the reason why`],
    ['20:39', `you have the successful thing is`],
    ['20:41', `probably why you had this long as you`],
    ['20:42', `tried so many times and that's I think`],
    ['20:45', `that this is also like basis of impostor`],
    ['20:48', `syndrome where people just feel like oh`],
    ['20:50', `they are so successful they've made the`],
    ['20:52', `successful thing and it seems like`],
    ['20:54', `everything they do turns to gold so you`],
    ['20:56', `actually had have one question whereas`],
    ['20:58', `like what is like a failure or something`],
    ['21:04', `bad that happened in your in your career`],
    ['21:07', `that was only your own fault like nobody`],
    ['21:10', `else was to blame well I actually`],
    ['21:12', `deleted the whole University database`],
    ['21:20', `because I didn't know what to do like`],
    ['21:22', `but then I was so in the university but`],
    ['21:25', `also working for the integrated system`],
    ['21:28', `that basically just ruled every single`],
    ['21:31', `thing Lee now people that use to get`],
    ['21:33', `scholarships people trying to get like`],
    ['21:36', `signed into enrolled in subjects and we`],
    ['21:39', `took care of just about everything and`],
    ['21:41', `the power that we had especially still`],
    ['21:44', `being students and we we had a lot of`],
    ['21:46', `exposition to front-end developer`],
    ['21:49', `development and back-end development and`],
    ['21:51', `DevOps and databases and obviously your`],
    ['21:54', `girl`],
    ['21:54', `you're gonna screw up cuz like there was`],
    ['21:57', `some very good and very experienced`],
    ['21:59', `people also working there obviously`],
    ['22:01', `otherwise like we would probably go`],
    ['22:03', `nowhere but also everybody had a lot of`],
    ['22:07', `room to experiment and and to try new`],
    ['22:10', `things and obviously I didn't know much`],
    ['22:12', `about database so I just I was intending`],
    ['22:15', `to drop a column I took the whole table`],
    ['22:18', `and then God we had to look for a backup`],
    ['22:22', `for I didn't know it was like a full day`],
    ['22:25', `and we finally come back up that was`],
    ['22:27', `outdated by two days which we're in that`],
    ['22:29', `hole but like we had a lot of angry`],
    ['22:33', `phone calls and I lied oh okay I just`],
    ['22:36', `updated why I'm not seeing like the`],
    ['22:37', `subject that I it wasn't rolled that it`],
    ['22:39', `was like but that was really important`],
    ['22:43', `for me because like after that I just a`],
    ['22:46', `lost all fear of like doing things that`],
    ['22:49', `I was in UsWe after the the first thing`],
    ['22:51', `that you fail you just feel like okay I`],
    ['22:53', `failed and I survived so I can move on`],
    ['22:56', `so like after that I I feel very much`],
    ['22:59', `comfortable in trying other things and I`],
    ['23:02', `feel like that was such a key moment in`],
    ['23:04', `my life that I don't think I would have`],

    ['23:12', `developer but also doing machine`],
    ['23:14', `learning stuff maybe that wouldn't`],
    ['23:15', `happen if it weren't for that absurd`],
    ['23:17', `that is such a great story partially`],
    ['23:20', `because it's important that you tell it`],
    ['23:22', `it's important to people that are`],
    ['23:25', `getting started to know that failure is`],
    ['23:28', `necessary is a necessary part of a solid`],
    ['23:31', `career development to learn that your`],

    ['23:37', `believe you think that it's such a thing`],
    ['23:40', `is going to kill you but it won't`],
    ['23:42', `and you go through it and you like`],
    ['23:44', `realize that everything can be worked`],
    ['23:46', `out and that's I think that's the that`],
    ['23:48', `was the most key takeaway from this`],
    ['23:50', `situation that I use it until this date`],
    ['23:53', `that was like five years ago and until`],
    ['23:55', `this day I still use that idea that okay`],
    ['23:58', `if something's broken we can fix it`],
    ['24:00', `that's what we do we solve problems we`],
    ['24:02', `as developers our our job is to solve`],
    ['24:05', `problems every day for users for us`],
    ['24:07', `the failure and and not being right as`],
    ['24:10', `an iteration and development is also a`],

    ['24:20', `never done especially when you work in a`],
    ['24:22', `in a product right now I don't really`],
    ['24:25', `have that that like day-to-day basis`],

    ['24:40', `care of like you're gonna try stuff that`],
    ['24:42', `aren't gonna work and that's probably`],
    ['24:44', `gonna be crucial for a different feature`],
    ['24:45', `that you didn't even imagine in the`],
    ['24:48', `first place`],
    ['24:49', `so I think that's super interesting for`],
    ['24:50', `like developers growing as professionals`],
    ['24:54', `so tell me about your talk okay in my`],
    ['25:03', `talk it's actually it was a really firm`],
    ['25:06', `ride for me to just make that talk`],
    ['25:08', `because I I just felt like I got used to`],
    ['25:12', `like a lot closer to reality in Brazil`],
