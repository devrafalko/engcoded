    ['00:03', `Hi guys!`],
    ['00:04', `Welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:05', `If you follow my Instagram,`],
    ['00:07', `you know that I like to take artsy selfies`],
    ['00:09', `because I have no one else to take pictures for me.`],
    ['00:12', `But I realize that I've gotten really good at`],
    ['00:14', `this thing of taking pictures of myself with my camera on the tripod`],
    ['00:18', `and my phone as the remote.`],
    ['00:20', `So today I want to do a fun little tutorial showing you how I do this.`],
    ['00:23', `And I also want to show you how I edit my photos in Lightroom`],
    ['00:27', `because I get a lot of questions on photo editing.`],
    ['00:29', `So I'll share all my secrets, my whole process from start to finish`],
    ['00:34', `of getting that cool look with you, yourself, and you.`],
    ['00:39', `Me, myself, and I.`],
    ['00:40', `You – yes.`],
    ['00:43', `Alright, let's get to it.`],
    ['00:44', `Step 1) Get dressed up and made up in a way that`],
    ['00:48', `makes you feel confident and beautiful!`],
    ['00:51', `Usually I’ll go through my closet and pick out an outfit`],
    ['00:53', `that fits the way I want to feel that day.`],
    ['00:55', `Today, I have purple hair so I really wanted something to complement that.`],
    ['01:00', `I picked out this minty off the shoulder dress`],
    ['01:02', `because I love how the color creates this pastel contrast with my hair.`],
    ['01:06', `If you have something in your closet that you love,`],
    ['01:08', `but don’t get a chance to wear it out often, wear it!`],
    ['01:11', `This is your time to shine.`],
    ['01:13', `After I have the outfit, I’m adding some accessories to match.`],
    ['01:17', `These are new earrings that I felt went with the dress,`],
    ['01:20', `and the turquoise + purple gives off mystical vibes which I’m feeling today.`],
    ['01:24', `Then I’m just touching up my makeup,`],
    ['01:26', `adding some highlight, and we’re ready to go!`],
    ['01:28', `Step 2) Pick a background that suits your style.`],
    ['01:32', `Mine is this area in my office with clean, pastel vibes.`],
    ['01:35', `You can also utilize plants and props to make your background more interesting.`],
    ['01:40', `Personally, I like to shoot in the late afternoon light`],
    ['01:43', `because sunlight spills into my room at that time`],
    ['01:45', `and there’s this golden glowy vibe.`],
    ['01:47', `Early morning sunlight works well too`],
    ['01:49', `but I’m never awake that early.`],
    ['01:51', `Step 3) Set your camera on a tripod.`],
    ['01:54', `If you don’t have a camera,`],
    ['01:55', `this is where you’d set your phone on the tripod.`],
    ['01:58', `Lately I’ve been setting the camera vertical for IG photos,`],
    ['02:01', `but that is just personal preference.`],
    ['02:03', `Take this time to also explore your favorite camera angle.`],
    ['02:06', `Do you like your camera lower or higher?`],
    ['02:08', `I like a lower camera angle so it makes me look a bit taller.`],
    ['02:12', `Camera tip: I shoot in RAW,`],
    ['02:14', `so that I have more information to edit the photo afterwards.`],
    ['02:17', `I set my aperture to the lowest setting, which on this lens is F/4,`],
    ['02:21', `because I love that depth of field, blurry background look.`],
    ['02:25', `My shutter speed is usually around 1/125.`],
    ['02:28', `And it also helps to have a flip out screen`],
    ['02:30', `so you can see what you’re shooting.`],
    ['02:33', `Step 4) Connect your remote for your camera.`],
    ['02:35', `I connect my camera to my phone with wifi,`],
    ['02:38', `but you can also use a camera remote or a self timer.`],
    ['02:41', `Step 5) Now it’s time to start shooting!`],
    ['02:45', `Play with your angles & poses and explore all the sides of your face`],
    ['02:48', `and all the shapes that your body can make.`],
    ['02:51', `This is all about exploration & experimentation.`],
    ['02:55', `You’re getting to know your face & body and learning all your “good sides”.`],
    ['02:59', `You don’t have just one good side, you have many!`],
    ['03:02', `Through this, you’ll also be more confident having your photo taken`],
    ['03:05', `because you know what looks good to you.`],
    ['03:07', `Let me emphasize here that it’s all relative and it’s all an art.`],
    ['03:11', `YOU are a work of art.`],
    ['03:13', `As self-absorbed as this process may seem,`],
    ['03:16', `you’re actually getting to know yourself,`],
    ['03:18', `and thus getting to love yourself.`],
    ['03:20', `Yes, your self love game will increase with your selfie game,`],
    ['03:24', `because you grow more comfortable`],
    ['03:26', `and confident in yourself through this process.`],
    ['03:29', `So don’t be self conscious and just have fun!`],
    ['03:32', `So previously I was taking instant photos with my phone in my hand as the remote.`],
    ['03:37', `But when I want to take a photo with both hands in the shot,`],
    ['03:39', `I’ll change the camera to a 2 sec timer,`],
    ['03:42', `then find a soft chair I can drop my phone onto after pressing the shutter.`],
    ['03:47', `Welcome to my secret: I’m constantly throwing my phone for these shots.`],
    ['03:51', `Luckily I have carpet in this room`],
    ['03:53', `because my phone will always bounce off the chair`],
    ['03:55', `and onto the floor, so that's that.`],
    ['03:57', `Step 6) Take a LOT of photos.`],
    ['04:00', `Switch up your camera position and angles if you want.`],
    ['04:03', `Again, it’s all about exploration & experimentation.`],
    ['04:06', `Play with movement.`],
    ['04:08', `Try throwing your arms up in different ways,`],
    ['04:10', `using your arms to create an artful structure.`],
    ['04:13', `It doesn’t have to be natural.`],
    ['04:14', `It’s art, okay?`],
    ['04:16', `You can also try playing with props as well.`],
    ['04:18', `I have this prism crystal that could be really fun to play with,`],
    ['04:21', `since it reflects light & images in an interesting way.`],
    ['04:25', `So what I’m doing here is placing the prism right in front of the lens`],
    ['04:28', `to create a reflective, kind of whimsical image.`],
    ['04:31', `Later I noticed that the prism was creating`],
    ['04:33', `a rainbow reflection on my face, which I really liked.`],
    ['04:36', `So I was working really hard at trying to get that rainbow in the right spot`],
    ['04:39', `and trying to get that perfect image.`],
    ['04:43', `By now my arm’s pretty tired and I think I’m about done.`],
    ['04:46', `"Okay, hopefully I got a good one."`],
    ['04:49', `Now let’s move on to editing in Lightroom!`],
    ['04:51', `Alright, here we are in Lightroom.`],
    ['04:53', `These are all the photos that we took today.`],
    ['04:55', `There are 127 photos and as you can see,`],
    ['04:58', `I have variations of the same poses,`],
    ['05:01', `just so I get a good one.`],
    ['05:04', `What I do now is: I look through each`],
    ['05:06', `and I press the shortcut "Z" on my keyboard to pick my favorites.`],
    ['05:11', `So let's do that.`],
    ['05:16', `Okay, so now that I've picked my favorites,`],
    ['05:19', `I'm going to filter by the unflagged and any rejected.`],
    ['05:24', `So these are all photos that I dislike,`],
    ['05:28', `so I'm going to delete them because I like to save space.`],
    ['05:32', `Delete 66 photos.`],
    ['05:35', `So now I'm left with the photos I liked.`],
    ['05:38', `I try to be more generous, just in case,`],
    ['05:41', `because I always change my mind on which one I like.`],
    ['05:44', `So let's pick a favorite.`],
    ['05:46', `Now I usually pick my favorite of each pose and I filter the photo from there.`],
    ['05:51', `In Lightroom, I do have a lot of different presets.`],
    ['05:55', `But sometimes I will start with the presets, sometimes I won't,`],
    ['05:59', `because sometimes I don't need to.`],
    ['06:01', `But I'll show you how I would filter without a preset.`],
    ['06:04', `I actually first start with a curve.`],
    ['06:07', `I love using curves lately.`],
    ['06:09', `I realize that what I really like is lowering the highlights a little bit,`],
    ['06:15', `bumping it up, creating a sort of S-curve shape.`],
    ['06:18', `Then I will just play in this area: bump up exposure if I need to.`],
    ['06:24', `And I love bright, milky, dreamy, airy photos.`],
    ['06:27', `You guys have seen my Instagram and you know what I like.`],
    ['06:31', `I really try to bump it as much as possible but still try to keep the contrast.`],
    ['06:37', `I prefer less shadows.`],
    ['06:39', `I prefer to bump up the mids a little bit like this.`],
    ['06:43', `As you can see the curve, the mid is a little brightened.`],
    ['06:46', `I like that look.`],
    ['06:48', `So before … after.`],
    ['06:50', `I don't like my image to look that flat.`],
    ['06:53', `That's why I really like using the S curve to give it a little more punch.`],
    ['06:56', `Obviously this is the extreme version of the punch,`],
    ['06:59', `but I kind of like it around here.`],
    ['07:02', `So keep the mids light.`],
    ['07:04', `This is if you like a really flat, milky look.`],
    ['07:07', `Alright, so before … after.`],
    ['07:11', `You see how it already changed a lot and I didn't even fix the tones?`],
    ['07:15', `All I did was curves and play a little bit with exposure and shadows and blacks.`],
    ['07:21', `Generally, I like my photos a little warmer.`],
    ['07:25', `Sometimes warm is a look.`],
    ['07:28', `For this one, I kind of like –`],
    ['07:29', `because my hair is purple, I don't want to go too warm.`],
    ['07:32', `And the greens and pinks honestly look perfect to me, the way they were.`],
    ['07:36', `And usually I'll bump up the vibrance a little bit, not too much.`],
    ['07:40', `Color Mixer is actually another one of my favorite areas in Lightroom.`],
    ['07:44', `Sometimes – it depends on the photo,`],
    ['07:47', `but if I want lighter color skin,`],
    ['07:48', `you can bump up the luminance of the orange.`],
    ['07:51', `You could also lower it if you want more of a tan complexion.`],
    ['07:54', `I usually just bump it up a tiny bit.`],
    ['07:57', `If you have different toned skin, this is where you would mess with it.`],
    ['08:02', `The orange is the hue of your skin tone.`],
    ['08:05', `I honestly like the natural look of this.`],
    ['08:08', `Okay, here's another thing I play with.`],
    ['08:09', `Texture, usually people bump it up for texture.`],
    ['08:12', `Sometimes I soften the texture,`],
    ['08:14', `make it negative so that it has more of a softer look.`],
    ['08:17', `You see how this looks really soft and dreamy?`],
    ['08:19', `I kind of like that, except I just do it a little bit.`],
    ['08:23', `So starting from zero, I would just go down to 6 or something.`],
    ['08:28', `You can tell it kind of blurs out your fine lines a little bit,`],
    ['08:33', `so I like a little bit of that.`],
    ['08:35', `Same thing with clarity.`],
    ['08:37', `It has that same effect where it softens it a little bit,`],
    ['08:41', `so I'm just going to soften it a tiny bit so it looks a little more dreamy.`],
    ['08:47', `Grain is something fun that I do add occasionally.`],
    ['08:52', `Grain, it's easier to see it up close.`],
    ['08:56', `This is – let's add 15.`],
    ['08:58', `I honestly, sometimes I just like to have it there.`],
    ['09:02', `You might not be able to tell in the actual photo.`],
    ['09:04', `And that's that!`],
    ['09:05', `What I would do is copy,`],
    ['09:10', `and then I would paste this on literally all the other similar photos in the set.`],
    ['09:16', `You can paste it there, and now this pose is basically filtered for the most part.`],
    ['09:22', `You can go back and change them and filter them again later.`],
    ['09:25', `Alright, let's do another photo.`],
    ['09:28', `Let's do one of these rainbow-y photos.`],
    ['09:30', `I can never decide which one I like.`],
    ['09:32', `So I'm just going to paste the filter that I have on the first photo I worked on,`],
    ['09:36', `just so I don't have to work on it as much.`],
    ['09:38', `And as you can see, it doesn't exactly give me the look that I want`],
    ['09:41', `because this is a different photo with different lighting.`],
    ['09:44', `So each photo is different.`],
    ['09:45', `Going for that milky look again, maybe like this.`],
    ['09:49', `This one needs to be a little cooler.`],
    ['09:53', `Let's mess with the skin tone because I think the skin tone is a big factor in this one.`],
    ['09:58', `Let me make the clarity negative.`],
    ['10:01', `If there's greens in the background,`],
    ['10:03', `sometimes you want to mute the greens`],
    ['10:04', `because you don't want them to be too saturated.`],
    ['10:07', `So you can mute them.`],
    ['10:08', `You can change the tone of the greens too.`],
    ['10:11', `Let's make the greens lighter.`],
    ['10:13', `Yeah, I like this look.`],
    ['10:15', `So you can see – you see the green in the background?`],
    ['10:19', `I kind of like how this set looks from far away.`],
    ['10:21', `I might just do a multiple photo set.`],
    ['10:24', `Looks so dreamy-looking, love it.`],
    ['10:27', `So that is basically my process for editing on Lightroom.`],
    ['10:30', `I hope you enjoyed this video.`],
    ['10:32', `Let me know in the comments if you have questions or anything.`],
    ['10:35', `And let me know if you think this is too extra, but this is normal to me.`],
    ['10:39', `This is part of my daily life, guys.`],
    ['10:42', `Alright, love you so much!`],
    ['10:44', `Don't forget to subscribe, and I'll see you in the next one.`],
    ['10:47', `Bye!`]
