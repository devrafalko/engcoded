    ['00:00', `Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it.`],
    ['00:06', `We're living longer than ever before, which is great,`],
    ['00:09', `but an unforeseen consequence of this is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick.`],
    ['00:16', `Getting old currently means spending more time in pain.`],
    ['00:21', `So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing healthspans,`],
    ['00:29', `the part of our lives during which we're disease free.`],
    ['00:32', `To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects: aging itself.`],
    ['00:39', `Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress In the last few years,`],
    ['00:43', `with human trials about to begin in the near future.`],
    ['00:47', `Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now`],
    ['00:54', `INTRO`],
    ['01:02', `1: senescent cells.`],
    ['01:06', `Your cells have an expiration date.`],
    ['01:10', `Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes.`],
    ['01:13', `Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends.`],
    ['01:18', `This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves we have long segments of DNA called telomeres`],
    ['01:24', `that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces, but they shrink with every cell division.`],
    ['01:29', `In some cells, after a number of divisions the telomeres are gone, and the cell becomes a zombie, a senescent cell.`],
    ['01:37', `Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get the more of them are inside you.`],
    ['01:44', `They harmed tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age like diabetes and kidney failure.`],
    ['01:51', `But what if you could kill them off?`],
    ['01:54', `Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they pleased.`],
    ['02:00', `Older mice without senescent cells were more active. Their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer.`],
    ['02:07', `Overall, they lived up to 30 percent longer and in better health than average mice.`],
    ['02:13', `Since we can't genetically engineer all the cells in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells.`],
    ['02:20', `But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells?`],
    ['02:23', `Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged, but senescent cells don't.`],
    ['02:30', `It turns out that they underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die.`],
    ['02:35', `So in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein.`],
    ['02:40', `It killed 80 % of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells.`],
    ['02:46', `The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair.`],
    ['02:51', `As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving senescent cells and the first human trials will start soon.`],
    ['03:01', `2: NAD+`],
    ['03:03', `Cells are made of hundreds of millions of parts.`],
    ['03:07', `They're the structures, machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen.`],
    ['03:13', `All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt.`],
    ['03:17', `As we age, this process becomes less effective and so parts become crumpled, bunched up,`],
    ['03:23', `or are removed slower, or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need.`],
    ['03:28', `One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells ourselves to look after themselves.`],
    ['03:35', `At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20.`],
    ['03:40', `Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis.`],
    ['03:49', `But NAD+ can't enter cells so we can't get it as a pill.`],
    ['03:53', `But scientists notice that other more flexible substances could enter cells and would then turn into an NAD+ inside.`],
    ['04:01', `In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells.`],
    ['04:08', `They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan,`],
    ['04:15', `This even got NASA interested,`],
    ['04:17', `which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions.`],
    ['04:24', `There are human trials being planned right now,`],
    ['04:26', `but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan.`],
    ['04:31', `But NAD+ is a serious candidate and could become the first human anti-aging pill.`],
    ['04:38', `3: stem cells`],
    ['04:41', `Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells,`],
    ['04:49', `but they decline as we age and so we decline too.`],
    ['04:53', `Without new parts, human bodies break.`],
    ['04:57', `In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started to develop diseases`],
    ['05:04', `So they took stem cells from baby mice brains and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice,`],
    ['05:11', `more specifically the hypothalamus, a polyp that's involved in regulating a lot of bodily functions.`],
    ['05:17', `The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by secreting micro RNAs that regulated their metabolism.`],
    ['05:25', `After 4 months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice and on average, they lived ten percent longer.`],
    ['05:32', `Another study took stem cells from mice embryos and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice.`],
    ['05:39', `As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough their hair regrew faster.`],
    ['05:48', `Conclusion`],
    ['05:52', `What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging.`],
    ['05:58', `It requires a complex array of different therapies.`],
    ['06:01', `We can kill off senescent cells to clear away the junk,`],
    ['06:04', `give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap, all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication.`],
    ['06:11', `This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice.`],
    ['06:17', `There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent, but they are proof of concepts.`],
    ['06:24', `To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan, we need human trials.`],
    ['06:29', `We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now, and only scratched the surface of these ideas.`],
    ['06:36', `The field of healthspan extension needs more attention and funding.`],
    ['06:39', `If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain`],
    ['06:48', `If you now want to support the research on aging directly, you can do so at lifespan.io,`],
    ['06:53', `a community of people actively supporting the scientists working to cure aging.`],
    ['06:58', `Check them out to learn about the latest advances and visit their blog or group on Facebook.`],
    ['07:04', `The lifespan team also kindly supported the creation of this video with a donation and their expertise.`],
    ['07:10', `If you want to help us make more of our videos, you can do so on patreon.com.`],
