    ['00:00', `Never before in history, have there been so many people on Earth as right now.`],
    ['00:06', `Our numbers have skyrocketed, from 1 billion in 1800, to 2.3 billion in 1940, 3.7 billion in 1970, and 7.4 billion in 2016.`],
    ['00:20', `The world population increased fourfold in the last century, so what can we expect for the next century?`],
    ['00:27', `And what does population growth mean for our future?`],
    ['00:30', `Will there be mass-migration?`],
    ['00:32', `Overcrowded slums and megacities covering continents?`],
    ['00:36', `Diseases and pollution?`],
    ['00:38', `Chaos and violence over energy, water, and food?`],
    ['00:41', `And a human species focused only on sustaining itself?`],
    ['00:46', `Will population growth destroy our way of life?`],
    ['00:49', `Or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic?`],
    ['01:02', `In the 1960s population growth reached an unprecedented rate.`],
    ['01:07', `Which lead to apocalyptic prophecies.`],
    ['01:11', `The poor would pro-create endlessly and overrun the developed world.`],
    ['01:15', `The legend of overpopulation was born.`],
    ['01:19', `But it turns out high birth rates and the population explosion are not permanent features of some cultures or countries,`],
    ['01:26', `But rather a part of a four step process the whole world is going through,`],
    ['01:30', `The demographic transition.`],
    ['01:32', `Most developed countries have already made the transition, while other countries are doing it right now.`],
    ['01:38', `Let's go back to the 18th century, when the entire world, including Europe, was in the first stage of the demographic transition.`],
    ['01:45', `By today's standards, Europe was worse off, than a developing region, suffering from poor sanitation, poor diets, and poor medicine.`],
    ['01:54', `A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast, so the population hardly grew.`],
    ['02:00', `Women had between 4 and 6 children, but only 2 of them would reach adulthood.`],
    ['02:06', `Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK and bought the greatest change in human living conditions since the agricultural revolution.`],
    ['02:14', `People went from being peasants to workers.`],
    ['02:18', `Manufactured goods were mass produced and became widely available.`],
    ['02:22', `The sciences flourished and advanced transportation, communication, and medicine.`],
    ['02:28', `The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation.`],
    ['02:34', `Slowly this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raised standards of living and health care for the poor working population.`],
    ['02:43', `The second transition stage started.`],
    ['02:45', `Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine, meant people stopped dying all the time, especially so, at a very young age.`],
    ['02:52', `The result was a population explosion.`],
    ['02:55', `Doubling the UK's population between 1750 and 1850.`],
    ['03:00', `The main reasons families used to have lots of children was that only a few of them were likely to survive.`],
    ['03:05', `Now that had changed, so the third stage of transition was set in motion.`],
    ['03:10', `Fewer babies were conceived, and population growth slowed down.`],
    ['03:15', `Eventually a balance emerged, fewer people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable.`],
    ['03:23', `Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition.`],
    ['03:27', `This didn't only happen in the UK, more and more countries went through the four stages.`],
    ['03:33', `First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions.`],
    ['03:36', `Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion.`],
    ['03:41', `Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births, and population growth came to an end.`],
    ['03:47', `But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population still growing so fast?`],
    ['03:53', `Well, the children born in the population explosion of the 70s and 80s are having kids themselves now.`],
    ['03:58', `Leading to a noticeable spike in overall population.`],
    ['04:01', `But they are having far fewer children on average than their parents.`],
    ['04:05', `The average today is 2.5, it was 5, 40 years ago.`],
    ['04:10', `So as this generation gets older, and fertility declines further, the rate of population growth will keep on slowing.`],
    ['04:18', `This is true for every country.`],
    ['04:20', `In the west, we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world.`],
    ['04:24', `But actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage.`],
    ['04:28', `Just look at Bangladesh. In 1971, the average woman had 7 kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of 5.`],
    ['04:36', `In 2015, the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average.`],
    ['04:43', `This is the rule, not an exception, we're not special, we just had a head start.`],
    ['04:48', `It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 children, to less than 3.`],
    ['04:55', `Others are catching up fast. Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years; Bangladesh took just 20.`],
    ['05:02', `Iran managed it in 10 years.`],
    ['05:04', `All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch and the more support they get, the faster they catch up.`],
    ['05:11', `This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop, are so important,`],
    ['05:17', `No matter what your motivation is, whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth, or you just want fewer refugees coming into your country,`],
    ['05:25', `The simple truth is, that it's beneficial to you personally if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life.`],
    ['05:32', `And we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today.`],
    ['05:40', `So the future of global population growth is not an apocalyptic prophecy, it's a promise!`],
    ['05:46', `Population growth will come to an end.`],
    ['05:48', `The UN forecasts that the 12th billionth human will never be born at all.`],
    ['05:54', `And as the development level of the world rises, the number of people a higher education will increase tenfold.`],
    ['06:01', `Countries who used to be a need, will help advance development instead.`],
    ['06:07', `More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.`],
    ['06:14', `This video was a collaboration with Max Roser and ourworldindata, where he explores the progress of humanity through research and data visualisation.`],
    ['06:23', `Make sure to check it out!`],
    ['06:24', `In 2016 we were able to make more and better content than ever before, because of your support on Patreon.com.`],
    ['06:32', `Thank you so much and we will be back in the year 12,017.`]
