    ['00:13', `just want to share my perspective.`],
    ['00:15', `It's really easy to look up the word introvert and see that the definition is someone who is shy or quiet.`],
    ['00:22', `Obviously, I'm not going to say that that's flat-out wrong.`],
    ['00:24', `It's in the dictionary after all, but unfortunately, I feel like things are not so black and white.`],
    ['00:29', `I know it sounds crazy`],
    ['00:30', `but I didn't realize how introverted I am until very recently. And I think this is an`],
    ['00:35', `unbelievably valuable thing to know about yourself whether you're introverted or not. I'm just gonna speak for myself here.`],
    ['00:42', `Understanding who I am and, more crucially, how I operate has been a very confusing but important process for me.`],
    ['00:49', `I feel like as I figure these things out little by little I've been able to make better decisions`],
    ['00:54', `for myself and where I want to put my time. At my age, it feels like there's a lot of social pressure`],
    ['01:01', `to be a partying and sexually active like 21 year old, you know.`],
    ['01:06', `I think of movies like American Pie. And it's so backwards because even just a couple generations ago things were so different.`],
    ['01:13', `Now, however, that seems kind of like the image of happiness that we all see on social media and also mainstream media.`],
    ['01:19', `I explored this a lot during my 30 days without alcohol.`],
    ['01:24', `And that's a separate video`],

    ['01:32', `to squeeze the juice out of life in your twenties.`],
    ['01:34', `And I know that me saying I'm an introvert is going to surprise some of you guys because like I'm not socially awkward.`],
    ['01:41', `I don't have a problem speaking to the camera.`],
    ['01:44', `Speaking in front of people. Speaking with people. I can be really loud.`],
    ['01:49', `I mean I love connecting with people.`],
    ['01:53', `That's the whole reason why I'm doing this, you know human interactions fascinate me`],
    ['01:57', `but above all I think that the most`],
    ['02:00', `important relationship that you have in life is with yourself. For me, everything fits into three categories.`],
    ['02:06', `Very close deep relationships. These kinds of relationships feed me, and my creativity.`],
    ['02:11', `Finding people that I can connect with on or even close to this level is really difficult though and doesn't happen very often.`],
    ['02:18', `In fact, I've never met somebody that I can fully connect with creatively and spiritually.`],
    ['02:24', `Superficial relationships`],
    ['02:26', `These are people that you have surface level conversations with where basically nothing is being said, nothing of depth, I mean.`],
    ['02:34', `These kinds of relationships and interactions. Don't just drain me, um`],
    ['02:39', `after a while they fill me with desperation`],
    ['02:42', `I have this feeling of being trapped and wanting to escape I know that sounds very dramatic`],
    ['02:47', `But I can't really explain it beyond that. It's just one of the reasons why I have always hated`],
    ['02:54', `amusement parks, malls, and clubs.`],
    ['02:57', `And finally, there's time alone.`],
    ['02:59', `I put this in the same category as like food, water,`],
    ['03:03', `exercise, and sleep. Basically an absolute necessity`],
    ['03:07', `for me to`],
    ['03:08', `Properly function as a human being and it's not just that, this is where I want to spend the majority of my time.`],
    ['03:14', `There is so much for me to explore`],
    ['03:16', `within my own mind`],
    ['03:18', `emotionally creatively, I mean I really do think about this a lot`],
    ['03:21', `I'm at the very dawn of my career still there's still so much for me to discover and I get excited`],
    ['03:27', `Just talking about it`],
    ['03:28', `and`],
    ['03:29', `When you get that excited about something why wouldn't you want to put all your time and energy into it now Carl Jung the famous?`],
    ['03:36', `Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst had some very interesting things to say about`],
    ['03:41', `Introversion and extraversion. To start he said, "What appears to be random behavior is actually the result of differences in the way people`],
    ['03:49', `prefer to use their mental capacities." To me`],
    ['03:52', `that's a mind-blowing statement because it's so true, and yet it's so simply stated.`],
    ['03:56', `He also said, "Each person seems to be energized more by either the external world`],
    ['04:01', `Extraversion, or the internal world, introversion; and I think that's the key right there`],
    ['04:05', `Like I said, I don't see things as being so black-and-white`],
    ['04:08', `But I do believe that we all lean in one direction or another. I'm not sure if this has learned behavior`],
    ['04:13', `I feel like as a kid I was at least a little bit more extroverted and`],
    ['04:18', `Maybe it depends on like the stage of life that you're at, you know if you're going through a period of introspection`],
    ['04:23', `Everyone in my immediate family is the exact same way`],
    ['04:26', `It's kind of hilarious`],
    ['04:31', `If you know or think that maybe you're an introvert`],
    ['04:34', `Embrace it, there is no shame in choosing not to hang out with other people and do your own thing`],
    ['04:39', `Of course`],
    ['04:40', `This is kind of a fine line because in my opinion there is no`],
    ['04:43', `excuse not to develop your social skills and your ability to communicate. Warren Buffett said, "If you can't communicate,`],
    ['04:50', `it's like winking at a girl in the dark - nothing happens.`],
    ['04:53', `You can have all the brainpower in the world,`],
    ['04:55', `but you have to be able to transmit it. And the transmission is`],
    ['04:59', `communication." That quote kind of makes me laugh because it's true`],
    ['05:02', `All I'm trying to say is that I don't think it's healthy to always be avoiding the things that make you uncomfortable`],
    ['05:07', `And that's an important distinction that I'm trying to make if you're invited to a party for example`],
    ['05:12', `But don't want to go try to figure out what the real reason for`],
    ['05:16', `This is it might just be that you don't want to hang out with people and you need time to recharge`],
    ['05:20', `Which is totally fine, but it also might be the fact that you're actively avoiding people`],
    ['05:26', `And that's a totally different story`],
    ['05:27', `I'm definitely not an expert on any of this stuff`],
    ['05:30', `But I believe that the only way to get better at communication is by doing it, by the way`],
    ['05:35', `I have my own issues with connecting with people. I also have awkward interactions but deeper than that`],
    ['05:41', `I feel like I'm often`],
    ['05:43', `disappointed by the people that I get to know more deeply as I get to know somebody on a deeper level I`],
    ['05:49', `Invariably get to know aspects of their character or their ethics or their emotional intelligence`],
    ['05:55', `That I don't align with right and that begins to turn me away from them. Now. There are a few solid takeaways from that`],
    ['06:02', `I think one diversity I think is really not a bad thing - nobody's perfect. They don't exist`],
    ['06:09', `Thank God actually and if they did why would they want to hang out with me another imperfect person?`],
    ['06:15', `I have a very close relationship with both my parents and my brother and`],
    ['06:20', `When I lived with them`],
    ['06:21', `We would fight all the time and disagree on a whole host of things down to stupid like how to properly load the dishwasher`],
    ['06:28', `I'm not kidding. However, okay on the flip side, I think it is good to have high standards`],
    ['06:35', `I truly do believe that the five people that you spend the most time with`],
    ['06:39', `Really do have a major impact on you and what that means is that I can't give up if I stopped trying to meet people`],
    ['06:45', `Altogether, I would I really would end up`],
    ['06:48', `Isolated so I signed up to a couple of art classes`],
    ['06:51', `Basically, this ends up becoming kind of a balancing act and I'm definitely still figuring things out for myself either way`],
    ['06:58', `I think that my ability to communicate which I worked really hard at by the way`],
    ['07:03', `Might be one of the most valuable skills that I have and finally a lot of people ask me about loneliness`],
    ['07:09', `Once again, and without trying to push things too far to the extreme`],
    ['07:12', `I do prefer to be alone than in bad company while this isn't like a major problem for me I do face`],
    ['07:20', `feelings of loneliness from time to time but the truth is like I feel like the path to getting to know yourself and`],
    ['07:27', `Introspection can be lonely sometimes I think that is a small price to pay for doing something that most people aren't willing to do`],
    ['07:34', `Which is to get to know yourself better. I`],
    ['07:37', `Wanted to make this video because I think introverts kind of a bad reputation of being socially awkward`],
    ['07:44', `timid reclusive and by extension`],
    ['07:47', `boring, I mean`],
    ['07:48', `I thought that for a very long time maybe I'm biased about all this but I actually think that the world could use more`],
    ['07:54', `introversion right now`],
    ['07:56', `More time from all of us dedicated to getting to know ourselves`],
    ['08:01', `What do you think? If you enjoyed this video? There are a few ways that you can help support this project`],
    ['08:06', `I have a patreon page where I upload bonus and exclusive content, and this helps me rely less on`],
    ['08:12', `Sponsorships to keep all this going also if you follow me on instagram or sign up to my newsletter`],
    ['08:17', `There's a better chance of me reaching you again instead of being drowned out by the avalanche of content on youtube`],
    ['08:23', `Thank you for watching. I really appreciate your time and all the wonderful messages and comments that you send me`],
    ['08:29', `I don't even know what to say. I'm a lucky person to be able to do this`],
