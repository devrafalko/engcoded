    ['00:04', `five thousand classes that could teach you a new life skill.`],
    ['00:08', `We rarely witness evolution on a timeframe short enough for a single human life to take`],
    ['00:13', `notice. These changes usually occur over many lifetimes, the gradual drift of a creatures`],
    ['00:18', `DNA to best survive their environment. But in one case in the 1700s humans witnessed`],
    ['00:24', `evolution with their own eyes, and they caused it. This metamorphosis coincided with human’s`],
    ['00:30', `rapid industrialization. We began burning coal on levels never before seen, and it’s`],
    ['00:35', `bi-products rapidly changed the landscape for not just humans, but for the animals that`],
    ['00:39', `shared the planet with them.`],
    ['00:41', `The peppered moth was one of those animals, getting its name from its speckled white and`],
    ['00:46', `black colouring, designed to camouflage the moth while it lay on lichen covered tree barks.`],
    ['00:51', `A black variant was first observed in 1811, many decades into the industrial revolution.`],
    ['00:57', `At first the mutation was rare, but human’s influence on the environment grew, so did`],
    ['01:02', `their numbers. By 1895, 98% of the peppered moths in Manchester had this black colouring`],
    ['01:08', `[1] Surely this black colouring would leave them exposed, making them easier to spot for`],
    ['01:13', `hungry birds. In reality, these moths had adapted to be harder to spot in this newly`],
    ['01:18', `industrialised world, one stained by soot.`],
    ['01:22', `And it may be time for humans to follow their lead. To evolve, or die. The rate we have`],
    ['01:26', `been spewing these pollutants into our atmosphere has only risen since this discover. Our carbon`],
    ['01:32', `dioxide emissions have risen from one thousand six hundred million metric tonnes to thirty`],
    ['01:38', `six thousand million metric tonnes since 1865 [2] And despite our best efforts, that number`],
    ['01:43', `is not declining. Human population and development are continuing to outpace our efforts to curbed`],
    ['01:50', `our carbon dioxide emissions.`],
    ['01:52', `Just as alcohol producing yeast will eventually create an environment too toxic for itself`],
    ['01:57', `to survive, humans are pumping the world’s atmosphere with a gas that will eventually`],
    ['02:01', `render the world unlivable for many, if something is not done. So we have to ask ourselves now,`],
    ['02:08', `are going the way of a mindless single cell fungi that continue to poison their habitat`],
    ['02:12', `until they die, or are we going to recognise that the survival of the next generation is`],
    ['02:17', `more important?`],
    ['02:19', `Our previous videos have discussed ways to mitigate climate change, by planting trees`],
    ['02:23', `in the Sahara or by using aerosols to block out the sun. Both are pretty extreme methods,`],
    ['02:29', `and come with some big risks that could lead to some unforeseen consequences. Instead of`],
    ['02:33', `some risky engineering tactic, what if we could just suck the CO₂ right out of the`],
    ['02:38', `air, undoing some of the damage that has been done?`],
    ['02:41', `Well, in certain circumstances, this is already happening. Carbon capture and storage (CCS)`],
    ['02:47', `has been around for years. There are a few main types of carbon capture, almost all of`],
    ['02:52', `which happens at power plants, capturing the carbon that comes directly from the plant.`],
    ['02:57', `In post-combustion ­carbon capture, the CO₂ is captured after the fossil fuel is burned.`],
    ['03:03', `In this method, CO₂ is separated from the flue gas, which includes CO₂, water vapor,`],
    ['03:09', `sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides, by bubbling the gas through an absorber column packed`],
    ['03:14', `with liquid solvents, such as ammonia. In the most widely used system, once the chemicals`],
    ['03:19', `in the absorber column become saturated, a stream of superheated steam at around 120C`],
    ['03:25', `is passed through it. This releases the trapped CO₂, which can then be transported for storage`],
    ['03:31', `elsewhere. [3]`],
    ['03:32', `In pre-combustion carbon capture,­ CO₂ is trapped before it's diluted by other flue`],
    ['03:38', `gases. The fossil fuel is heated in pure oxygen, resulting in a mix of carbon monoxide and`],
    ['03:43', `hydrogen. [4]The carbon monoxide is reacted with water to produce carbon dioxide, which`],
    ['03:49', `is captured, along with hydrogen. The hydrogen can be used to produce electricity, and the`],
    ['03:54', `carbon dioxide is stored. [5]`],
    ['03:56', `Pre- and post-combustion carbon capture can prevent 80 to 90 percent of a power plant's`],
    ['04:01', `carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. [6] This is a big deal. The IPCC estimates`],
    ['04:07', `that carbon capture and storage has the potential to make up between 10% and 55% of the total`],
    ['04:13', `carbon mitigation effort until year 2100. [7]`],
    ['04:17', `However, this carbon has to be stored somewhere. It is most often stored underground in a process`],
    ['04:22', `called geological sequestration, which involves injecting CO₂ into underground rock formations.`],
    ['04:29', `It is stored as a supercritical fluid, meaning it has properties between those of a gas and`],
    ['04:34', `a liquid. When carbon dioxide is injected at depth, it will remain in the supercritical`],
    ['04:39', `condition as long as it stays in excess of 31.1°C and at a pressure in excess of 72.9`],
    ['04:47', `atmospheres. Many times, the carbon dioxide is injected into a reservoir which previously`],
    ['04:51', `trapped oil and gas, since those areas have natural rock formations that help to contain`],
    ['04:56', `the carbon dioxide. While this might be an okay solution, no one knows for sure what`],
    ['05:01', `the environmental impact could be if the carbon dioxide were to leak out into the environment`],
    ['05:05', `in large quantities. [8] In some instances, leakage of carbon dioxide underground has`],
    ['05:10', `been shown to increase plant mortality, reduce growth and create potentially severe localised`],
    ['05:16', `damage to ecosystems. For this to be a viable, safe option, the carbon dioxide would need`],
    ['05:21', `to remain stored for 100s of years, or even indefinitely, and the feasibility of this`],
    ['05:26', `is not certain. [9]`],
    ['05:28', `Other methods of storing carbon include sinking it deep below the ocean, at depths under 3500`],
    ['05:33', `meters, where it turns into a slushy material that will sink to the ocean floor under that`],
    ['05:38', `amount of pressure. [10]But this method is largely untested, and again, there are concerns`],
    ['05:43', `about what this could mean for marine life, and uncertainty on whether or not the CO₂`],
    ['05:48', `could eventually make its way back into the environment. [11]`],
    ['05:52', `There have been more promising experiments in carbon storage in Iceland, where researchers`],
    ['05:56', `have shown that pumping carbon dioxide into the volcanic rock underground can speed up`],
    ['06:00', `a natural process where the basalts react with the gas to form carbonate minerals, which`],
    ['06:05', `make up limestone. This is an encouraging development, but has its limitations. It requires`],
    ['06:11', `large amounts of water: 25 tonnes for each tonne of carbon dioxide buried, meaning this`],
    ['06:16', `process would have to be limited to coastal sites. Another is that subterranean microbes`],
    ['06:20', `might break down carbonate to methane, another powerful greenhouse gas. [12]`],
    ['06:25', `And while 80 to 90 percent of a power plant’s carbon emissions can, in theory, be captured`],
    ['06:30', `and stored in one of many ways, what about all of the other carbon emitting things in`],
    ['06:35', `our world? Only 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity and heat production`],
    ['06:41', `at power plants. Transportation, general industry, and agriculture collectively make up around`],
    ['06:47', `60% of greenhouse gas emissions. [13] Is there a way to capture CO₂ from these sources?`],
    ['06:54', `Direct air capture has, up to recently, been a largely theoretical technique in which CO₂`],
    ['06:59', `is removed directly from the atmosphere. Theoretical, because doing this on a scale that would even`],
    ['07:04', `make a dent has historically been ridiculously expensive - some experts say as much as $600`],
    ['07:10', `per metric ton of carbon dioxide. For reference, a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6`],
    ['07:16', `metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. [14] But recently a team of scientists from Harvard`],
    ['07:21', `University and the Bill Gates funded company Carbon Engineering announced that they have`],
    ['07:25', `found a method to cheaply pull carbon-dioxide pollution out of the atmosphere - they say`],
    ['07:30', `for as little as $94, and for no more than $232 per metric ton of CO₂. This means that`],
    ['07:37', `it would cost between $1 and $2.50 to remove the carbon dioxide released by burning a gallon`],
    ['07:42', `of gasoline in a modern car. And not only do they suck the CO₂ out of the air with`],
    ['07:48', `the ability to store it - they will also transform the carbon back in to gasoline or jet fuel,`],
    ['07:54', `creating net-neutral carbon based fuels. [15]`],
    ['07:56', `While this sounds too good to be true, the methods they use to pull CO₂ out of the`],
    ['08:01', `air is not too different from what has already been done for decades.`],
    ['08:05', `This type of direct air capture starts with an air contractor, where air is sucked in`],
    ['08:08', `at high volumes. This structure “wet scrubs” the air by using a strong hydroxide solution`],
    ['08:13', `to capture CO₂ and convert it into carbonate. The hydroxide solution reacts with carbon`],
    ['08:18', `dioxide to form carbonate ions(CO32−.) This occurs within a structure which is much the`],
    ['08:23', `same as an industrial cooling tower.`],
    ['08:26', `The next step involves a “pellet reactor” where the carbonate ion reacts with calcium(Ca2+)`],
    ['08:30', `to form calcium carbonate, in the form of dried pellets.`],
    ['08:34', `Then, a circulating fluid heats the calcium carbonate pellets to decomposition temperature,`],
    ['08:40', `breaking them apart to release the carbon dioxide as a gas and leave behind calcium`],
    ['08:44', `oxide (CaO) [16]`],
    ['08:45', `Finally, the carbon dioxide is combined with hydrogen and converted into liquid fuels,`],
    ['08:50', `including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, using the Fischer-Tropsch process. This is`],
    ['08:55', `a process where a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen are converted into liquid hydrocarbons.`],
    ['09:00', `These reactions occur in the presence of metal catalysts and typically at temperatures of`],
    ['09:05', `150–300 °C. [17]`],
    ['09:07', `This means the company can produce carbon-neutral hydrocarbons, meaning if you were to burn`],
    ['09:12', `this fuel in your car, you would release carbon-dioxide pollution out of your exhaust and into the`],
    ['09:17', `atmosphere. But because this carbon dioxide came from the air in the first place, these`],
    ['09:22', `emissions would not introduce any new carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and no oil would`],
    ['09:27', `need to be extracted from the earth to power your car. And perhaps most importantly for`],
    ['09:32', `the economic viability of this idea, they can sell the product, which helps to offset`],
    ['09:37', `costs, allowing them to capture even more carbon dioxide, to either convert back into`],
    ['09:41', `hydrocarbons or ultimately store.`],
    ['09:44', `And backing up their cost estimates of between $94 and $232 per metric ton of carbon dioxide`],
    ['09:51', `is the fact that they’ve actually tested the technology in a prototype plant for a`],
    ['09:55', `few years in Squamish, British Columbia, which offers a proof of concept that’s way stronger`],
    ['10:00', `than simple calculations or computational models. It currently captures and processes`],
    ['10:04', `around 1 ton of carbon dioxide per day. [18]`],
    ['10:07', `However, for this idea to work on a large scale, the process has to be cost-effective`],
    ['10:12', `to implement cheaply around the world, without the massive costs of constructing all-new`],
    ['10:17', `factory parts. In the pilot plant, they pulled all this off by designing a factory based`],
    ['10:22', `entirely on parts that suppliers could already make cheaply and by keeping careful track`],
    ['10:27', `of their emissions and costs at each stage of the design and production process. They`],
    ['10:31', `are currently seeking funding for an industrial-scale version of the plant, that will use low-cost`],
    ['10:36', `renewable energy, that will produce 200 barrels of synthetic fuel a day, which they hope to`],
    ['10:42', `complete by 2021. [19]`],
    ['10:44', `But how much carbon can they realistically hope to suck out of the air? In 2017, the`],
    ['10:49', `world emitted about 32.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide. If this technology were built at`],
    ['10:55', `a scale to suck all that back out of the atmosphere at $93 to $232 per ton, simple math shows`],
    ['11:02', `that the total cost would be between about $3 trillion and $7.5 trillion. [20] That seems`],
    ['11:07', `like a lot, but many industries are worth more than that, including Apple or the airline`],
    ['11:12', `industry. Definitely a tall order, but not impossible.`],
    ['11:16', `For this idea to work globally in pulling substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from`],
    ['11:20', `the Earth’s air, there would need to be hundreds or thousands of scaled-up plants`],
    ['11:24', `producing hundreds of thousands of barrels of carbon-neutral fuel to drive down costs`],
    ['11:29', `further, in the same way that solar and wind energy costs have plummeted over the past`],
    ['11:33', `decades with increasing scales`],
    ['11:36', `However, to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees C, the international target to avoid`],
    ['11:41', `the most dangerous impacts, we will need negative emissions, not carbon neutral emissions. We`],
    ['11:46', `need carbon to be taken out of the atmosphere and stored permanently, or the problem will`],
    ['11:51', `only plateau indefinitely. And if Carbon Engineering is making fuel from their captured carbon,`],
    ['11:56', `this is only a carbon-neutral plan.`],
    ['11:59', `But the reality of the situation is that when you are only capturing and storing carbon,`],
    ['12:03', `there is no market for that. The only way to pay for carbon being captured from the`],
    ['12:07', `air and stored, on a large scale, would be government subsidies, and to rely on only`],
    ['12:12', `our governments to solve this problem is certainly a mistake. And at $100 per ton at the moment,`],
    ['12:17', `there aren’t enough carbon dioxide buyers in the market for any other uses to make a`],
    ['12:22', `dent.`],
    ['12:23', `Thus, introducing the idea of selling back the carbon as fuel is a way to fund such an`],
    ['12:28', `effort. With market demand and money coming in, companies like Carbon Engineering can`],
    ['12:32', `improve their technology, expand operations, store some carbon, and work toward making`],
    ['12:38', `sure that less oil is extracted from the ground over time.`],
    ['12:42', `Critics say that we should simply just not be taking the carbon out of the ground in`],
    ['12:45', `the first place, focusing on reducing emissions rather than capture and storage, or capture`],
    ['12:50', `and re-use. And some worry that technology like this will allow us to think that we have`],
    ['12:55', `no responsibility to reduce emissions. And it is cheaper to not emit a ton of carbon`],
    ['13:00', `dioxide in the first place than to capture it. While these are all definitely valid points,`],
    ['13:05', `technology like this can and should play a role in how we tackle climate change. It’s`],
    ['13:11', `unrealistic to think that every industry, every consumer, and every government in the`],
    ['13:15', `world will change their behavior in time to tackle the rising global temperatures, as`],
    ['13:19', `much as we wish they would. And technology like this will go a long way to help mitigate`],
    ['13:25', `the negative effects of industries where a carbon zero result is next to impossible,`],
    ['13:30', `like steel or cement manufacturing, or long-distance air travel.`],
    ['13:34', `So this may not be a silver bullet curing the world of climate change, but it is definitely`],
