    ['00:04', `that teaches you to think like an Engineer.`],
    ['00:07', `Next time you’re near the ocean, listen closely to the waves. That sound you hear?`],
    ['00:12', `That’s wasted energy.`],
    ['00:14', `The energy from waves, tides and currents, known collectively as ocean energy, is a massive`],
    ['00:20', `resource just waiting to be tapped.`],
    ['00:23', `The total energy available along the American continental shelf could potentially provide`],
    ['00:28', `roughly half of the current total US energy supply. [1] With an estimated 250 TWh/yr for`],
    ['00:37', `the West Coast, 160 TWH/yr for the East Coast, 60 TWh/y for the Gulf of Mexico, 620 TWh/y`],
    ['00:44', `for Alaska, 80 TWh/yr for Hawaii, and 20 TWh/yr for Puerto Rico. [1]`],
    ['00:48', `Harassing all of that energy, while transporting it to population centres and finding suitable`],
    ['00:53', `locations along the coast that will not affect coastline ecosystems and property values would`],
    ['00:58', `be a difficult if not an impossible task, but if we could find a suitable way to harass`],
    ['01:04', `the power of the tides and waves off our coasts, it could provide the final push needed to`],
    ['01:09', `convert out grid to a 100% renewable system [2]`],
    ['01:14', `There are many methods to gain energy from the sea. Wave power is created as the wind`],
    ['01:19', `pushes the surface of the ocean. Ocean currents provide power driven predominantly by wind`],
    ['01:25', `and heat from the sun. Some systems have even utilized the differences in salinity between`],
    ['01:30', `rivers and seas to produce electricity.`],
    ['01:33', `However, today we are going to investigate one of the most promising technologies in`],
    ['01:37', `this sector, Tidal Energy. It has huge potential in the renewable energy market thanks to its`],
    ['01:43', `predictable and consistent availability. Tides change four times a day, every day.`],
    ['01:50', `This is a result of the Earth rotating through bulges of ocean water formed by the gravitational`],
    ['01:55', `influence of the Sun and Moon. We experience greater tides, called Spring Tides, when the`],
    ['02:00', `Sun is aligned with the Moon allowing their gravitational influence to combine. [3] This`],
    ['02:05', `corresponds to the New and Full Moon phases of the Moon. And we experience smaller tides,`],
    ['02:11', `and smaller differences in high and low tide, during Neap Tides. This occurs when the Moon`],
    ['02:16', `is at a quarter phase, offset to the Sun by 90 degrees. Meaning our tides are not only`],
    ['02:22', `smaller in total, but the changes in tide are minimised.`],
    ['02:27', `While their intensity does vary, these tidal changes come 4 times a day and result in a`],
    ['02:31', `flow of water that will look something like this for a Spring Tide and this for a Neap`],
    ['02:36', `Tide. [4] With the Spring Tide not only resulting in a higher tide, but a faster flow of water,`],
    ['02:43', `which means more energy is available for extraction.`],
    ['02:47', `These patterns can be projected well into the future thanks to the predictable movement`],
    ['02:51', `of the Sun, Moon and Earth. Which definitely cannot be said for the unpredictable weather`],
    ['02:57', `here on earth which affects Wind and Solar energy.`],
    ['03:01', `Despite this steady and reliable flow of water, ocean power provides the smallest percentage`],
    ['03:06', `of renewable energy. With only two large scale tidal energy plants, a 240 MW system [5] located`],
    ['03:14', `in the estuary of the Rance River in Northern France, and a 254 MW system in Sihwa Lake`],
    ['03:21', `in South Korea [6]. Both are tidal barrage systems, which work similarly to dams by opening`],
    ['03:27', `and closing sluice gates to control the flow of water through their turbines. This is a`],
    ['03:32', `proven technology, proving they can generate electricity and operate in seawater without`],
    ['03:38', `corrosion being a massive issue thanks to cathodic protection. [7]`],
    ['03:42', `So why are there so few of these systems in the world. The problem is two-fold. First,`],
    ['03:48', `the cost of installation is incredibly high requiring a very large structure to control`],
    ['03:53', `the flow of water. It simply makes more sense to use other forms of renewables like wind`],
    ['03:58', `and solar. And second, a large barrier like this has a significant effect on the local`],
    ['04:04', `ecosystem.`],
    ['04:06', `One company, Simec Atlantis, is looking to improve on both of these points with their`],
    ['04:11', `underwater turbines which look remarkably like normal wind turbines, but thanks to water's`],
    ['04:16', `higher density can be much smaller.`],
    ['04:20', `Their first prototype system was placed here in the mouth of Strangford lough in Ireland.`],
    ['04:25', `This area benefits from some of the fastest flowing water in Ireland, as tides force their`],
    ['04:30', `way in and out of the bottleneck of Strangford Lough. Millions of tonnes of water flow through`],
    ['04:36', `the channel every day. [8]`],
    ['04:38', `The system consisted of two 16 metre diameter turbines with a nameplate capacity of 0.6`],
    ['04:45', `MWs each. [8] For reference an equivalent wind turbine would have a diameter around`],
    ['04:51', `40 metres. These turbines reached full capacity in November 2008 and were decommissioned in`],
    ['04:57', `May 2016. [9] If that 1.2 MWs ran continuously at full capacity for all that time it would`],
    ['05:05', `result in about 77-79 GWhs of power, however it only produced 11.6 GWhs. [10] Enough to`],
    ['05:14', `power around 1 thousand American homes for 1 year, but that’s just 15% of its full`],
    ['05:21', `potential. That percentage is called a capacity factor and 15% is a very low capacity factor,`],
    ['05:28', `with Ireland’s 5 year average wind energy capacity factor standing around 28%. [11]`],
    ['05:35', `However this was a prototype which did not run continuously and was routinely taken offline`],
    ['05:41', `for inspection and research. In their best month, SeaGen produced 522 MWhs with a capacity`],
    ['05:49', `factor of 59% and Seagen claim that is reproducible year round. [12] With a capacity factor of`],
    ['05:57', `59% year round this would make tidal energy an incredibly reliable energy source with`],
    ['06:03', `only minimal storage needed to smoothen out the peaks and troughs between the tides. With`],
    ['06:09', `a short time between peak power generation and minimum power generation, this form of`],
    ['06:14', `tidal energy could use cheaper short-term energy storage solutions like mechanical batteries`],
    ['06:21', `to create a desperately needed renewable baseload.`],
    ['06:25', `This project was decommissioned in 2016, as part of the research process. It was vitally`],
    ['06:31', `important to test whether these machines could be effectively removed from the environments`],
    ['06:37', `with minimal impact. [13] And this is of course a major concern for any machinery being placed`],
    ['06:42', `into a marine environment. Seagen satisfied this requirement having no significant effect`],
    ['06:48', `on the local ecosystem, and they have since moved onto the next stage of their technology`],
    ['06:54', `with Meygen, installed in between the Island of Stroma and the North East coast of Scotland.`],
    ['07:00', `Their original lease agreement was for up 400 Megawatts, provided the initial testing`],
    ['07:05', `phase with 4 turbines satisfied the environmental impact requirements. [14]`],
    ['07:11', `The latest version of the underwater turbine now has 3 turbine blades, allowing for an`],
    ['07:16', `increase in capacity to 1.5 MegaWatts with only a slightly increased diameter turbine`],
    ['07:22', `over the 16 metre 0.5 MegaWatt turbines of their previous project in Northern Ireland.`],
    ['07:29', `This turbine is also completely submerged, so it is not an eyesore for local residents.`],
    ['07:35', `Seagen previously had actuators to lift the turbine out of the water to allow maintenance`],
    ['07:40', `to occur, but the new generation of turbines are designed so the actual turbines and generators`],
    ['07:46', `can simply be placed and removed from the substructure in about 30 minutes. [15] Making`],
    ['07:51', `installation and maintenance vastly easier and cheaper.`],
    ['07:56', `Environmental impact has been a central focus for the project and this started with a comprehensive`],
    ['08:02', `survey of the surrounding ecosystem from seaweed and shellfish to the whales that occasionally`],
    ['08:08', `visit the area.`],
    ['08:09', `The area thankfully has such fast moving water that the seabed was stripped of sand and silt,`],
    ['08:15', `so the installation had little impact on ecology of the rocky seafloor.`],
    ['08:20', `The impact the installation could have on local marine mammals was of much larger concern`],
    ['08:26', `with surveys showing a large population of both seals and dolphins, with several haul`],
    ['08:31', `out areas for seals nearby. [16] Both of these mammals are sensitive to noise and will likely`],
    ['08:37', `avoid any area with excessive sound. The noise levels these turbines emit are not terribly`],
    ['08:43', `high, as they move relatively slowly through the water. Their 544 page long environmental`],
    ['08:49', `report, which I read to the best of my ability in the 1 week of research I did for this video,`],
    ['08:55', `indicates that seals will have a strong avoidance of the noise within 38 metres of the structures,`],
    ['09:01', `while mild avoidance may extend as far as 168 metres. [17] With seal haulouts over a`],
    ['09:07', `kilometre away this was deemed acceptable. While dolphins are expected to avoid the noise`],
    ['09:12', `up to 100 metres and filter feeders like whales up to 500 metres, which may remove a small`],
    ['09:19', `section of sea from use, but will not act as a barrier to any significant feeding ground.`],
    ['09:25', `A significant improvement over tidal barrages.`],
    ['09:28', `This theory is backed up by surveys conducted during Seagen’s operation which found little`],
    ['09:34', `evidence that the two turbines had a significant effect on the numbers of seals and dolphins`],
    ['09:39', `during operation, but did have an effect during the construction phase where noise was much`],
    ['09:45', `higher. [18]`],
    ['09:46', `Area avoidance would be useful in the fact that it would prevent the animals from straying`],
    ['09:50', `too close to the turbines and being struck by them. Potentially hurting themselves and`],
    ['09:55', `damaging the turbine. Once again we can garner some positive data from Seagen, which examined`],
    ['10:00', `all carcasses discovered near the site and found no evidence that any deaths were caused`],
    ['10:06', `by impacts to the turbines. [19]`],
    ['10:08', `This seems unlikely but they theorize that these animals actually avoid the areas while`],
    ['10:12', `the turbine is operating not because of sound, but because the water is flowing fast enough`],
    ['10:17', `to make it too difficult to swim and catch prey.`],
    ['10:20', `The last major worry for these types of devices is the fact that they need to use toxic anti-fouling`],
    ['10:26', `coatings to prevent marine growth on the turbines. However Meygen uses a clever low friction`],
    ['10:32', `paint that self cleans as soon as the marine growth grows large enough where the drag overcomes`],
    ['10:37', `their ability to adhere to the slippery paint.`],
    ['10:41', `Additionally they trialed a sonar detection system that would allow them to track and`],
    ['10:45', `potentially stop the turbines when larger animals occasional pass through the area.`],
    ['10:50', `Without a doubt, these types of turbines would have less of an impact on the environment`],
    ['10:55', `than tidal barrages seen in France and South Korea, but only time will tell whether this`],
    ['11:00', `system in the far reaches of Scotland will have a small enough impact to encourage additional`],
    ['11:05', `systems to be installed.`],
    ['11:08', `Cost will still be a massive factor. Based on their companies financial reports the Meygen`],
    ['11:12', `project generated 2.7 million dollars of revenue for the company in 2018. That’s 0.675 million`],
    ['11:20', `dollars of revenue from each turbine. Based on their estimated cost for a further 49 turbines`],
    ['11:26', `at 540 million dollars, we can calculate that each would come with an installation cost`],
    ['11:32', `of around 11 million dollars, so that would require 16.3 years to recoup the cost of installation.`],
    ['11:39', `Which is better than the 20 years it took to recoup the costs of tidal barrage system`],
    ['11:43', `in France, and those numbers will likely continue to drop if the company manages to start manufacturing`],
    ['11:49', `these underwater turbines on a larger scale.`],
    ['11:52', `But it’s slow going. Iterating and improving on designs for tidal power is much more difficult`],
    ['11:58', `than other forms of renewable energy. Testing has to take place in coastal waters, most`],
    ['12:04', `of which are public spaces, requiring extensive permitting and testing.`],
    ['12:08', `It’s unlikely that these underwater turbines will ever compete on cost with onshore wind`],
    ['12:13', `turbines or solar, but thanks to the predictability of the tides this form of energy could provide`],
    ['12:19', `a reliable baseload when combined with low cost batteries.`],
    ['12:24', `If this project succeeds if could justify large scale manufacturing of these turbines`],
    ['12:29', `and transform tidal energy from a small niche industry, to a huge player in the renewable`],
    ['12:35', `energy industry.`],
    ['12:37', `After all, Meygen is just one small section of a larger 1600 MW ocean energy project earmarked`],
    ['12:45', `for Pentland Firth and Orkney, with mixes of both wave and tidal energy.[20]`],
    ['12:50', `A colossal amount of energy which could go a long way to diversifying Scotland’s power`],

    ['13:01', `In the meantime, you can learn more about other forms of renewable energies like solar`],
