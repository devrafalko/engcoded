    ['00:00', `Over the last few years,`],
    ['00:02', `organic food has spread like wildfire.`],
    ['00:05', `Despite higher prices,`],
    ['00:07', `buying organic is turning from an alternative`],
    ['00:10', `into a moral and social responsibility.`],
    ['00:13', `Organic food is supposedly healthier`],
    ['00:16', `more natural and more ethical.`],
    ['00:18', `But what do we even mean when we say organic?`],
    ['00:22', `There's no global consensus,`],
    ['00:24', `so different regions have different definitions and rules.`],
    ['00:28', `In general,`],
    ['00:29', `organic food is farmed without GMO seeds,`],
    ['00:32', `synthetic fertilizers,`],
    ['00:33', `or synthetic pesticides.`],
    ['00:35', `Instead,`],
    ['00:36', `organic farmers use more traditional ways of producing food,`],
    ['00:39', `like crop rotation,`],
    ['00:41', `and use organic fertilizers`],
    ['00:43', `such as compost or manure.`],
    ['00:45', `While the motivation to buy organic food is clearly noble,`],
    ['00:49', `is it actually effective`],
    ['00:50', `or just another costly trend we can skip`],
    ['00:53', `without feeling guilty?`],
    ['00:58', `[Music]`],
    ['01:03', `Is organic food healthier?`],
    ['01:06', `One idea associated with organic crops`],
    ['01:08', `is that their natural cultivation`],
    ['01:10', `is supposed to make them more nutritious and healthier.`],
    ['01:14', `Indeed,`],
    ['01:14', `several studies found that organic foods contain more antioxidants.`],
    ['01:20', `Plants produce them as a sort of homemade pesticide.`],
    ['01:23', `Organic plants seem to have to work a little harder,`],
    ['01:26', `while regular plants have plenty of help from humans.`],
    ['01:29', `Antioxidants are believed to have some health benefits,`],
    ['01:32', `although scientists are still on the fence about them in general.`],
    ['01:36', `We have no idea if and how exactly they help us,`],
    ['01:40', `or how much produce you'd have to eat to absorb a certain amount.`],
    ['01:44', `What about organic being more nutritious?`],
    ['01:47', `Well, the evidence is mixed.`],
    ['01:50', `Some studies found`],
    ['01:51', `that organic food can have slightly higher concentrations of vitamin C,`],
    ['01:55', `and omega-3 fatty acids,`],
    ['01:57', `while others did not find significant differences.`],
    ['02:00', `Overall, the mixed evidence`],
    ['02:02', `suggests that there are only small differences in nutritional value.`],
    ['02:07', `So, from the science available so far,`],
    ['02:09', `it doesn't look like organic food has significant health benefits.`],
    ['02:13', `What we do know,`],
    ['02:15', `is that eating fruit and veggies in general is good for you,`],
    ['02:18', `and most of us don't do that enough.`],
    ['02:20', `Eating veggies is more important for your health`],
    ['02:23', `than how they were produced.`],
    ['02:26', `Is organic food more natural?`],
    ['02:30', `People don't only buy organic to get extra vitamins,`],
    ['02:33', `but to avoid something toxic;`],
    ['02:35', `artificial pesticides and fertilizers.`],
    ['02:38', `And indeed several studies show`],
    ['02:40', `that there actually is less pesticide residue on organic produce.`],
    ['02:45', `But here's where things get complicated.`],
    ['02:48', `Less pesticide does not mean none at all.`],
    ['02:51', `While pesticides are supposed to be a last resort in organic farming,`],
    ['02:56', `they're not forbidden.`],
    ['02:57', `Most organic pesticides are natural toxins,`],
    ['03:00', `like vegetable oils,`],
    ['03:01', `hot ash soap,`],
    ['03:02', `sulfur or copper sulfates.`],
    ['03:04', `But there are synthetic substances as well.`],
    ['03:08', `What's the difference between organic and regular pesticides?`],
    ['03:12', `Not a lot actually.`],
    ['03:13', `Organic pesticides`],
    ['03:15', `are not necessarily safer than conventional ones.`],
    ['03:18', `Toxic is toxic.`],
    ['03:20', `No matter if the substance is manufactured,`],
    ['03:22', `or derived from nature.`],
    ['03:24', `In fact,`],
    ['03:25', `in the case of copper sulfate,`],
    ['03:27', `often used on organic apples,`],
    ['03:29', `the organic pesticide of choice`],
    ['03:30', `is actually more harmful to humans.`],
    ['03:33', `The toxicity of any substance`],
    ['03:35', `depends on its concentration`],
    ['03:37', `and your exposure to it --`],
    ['03:39', `not if it's natural or not.`],
    ['03:41', `There are a few recent studies`],
    ['03:43', `about how our current level of pesticide exposure`],
    ['03:46', `affects our long-term health.`],
    ['03:48', `The 2018 study from France`],
    ['03:50', `associated never eating organic food`],
    ['03:52', `with a higher risk of certain cancers.`],
    ['03:55', `The study was criticized a lot though.`],
    ['03:58', `The participants reported their dietary habits themselves,`],
    ['04:01', `while no actual tests of pesticide levels in their bodies were done.`],
    ['04:06', `Complicating things even more,`],
    ['04:07', `a Danish study from 2018`],
    ['04:09', `found that the danger from pesticides for an adult`],
    ['04:11', `was similar to drinking a glass of wine every three months.`],
    ['04:15', `The pesticides on your vegetables`],
    ['04:17', `are nothing to lose sleep over.`],
    ['04:19', `Despite this,`],
    ['04:20', `we should continue to demand strict standards for our food.`],
    ['04:24', `All pesticides are regulated and tested very strictly`],
    ['04:28', `in the EU and the US.`],
    ['04:30', `Every year,`],
    ['04:30', `thousands of food samples are screened for pesticides.`],
    ['04:34', `The majority of samples have no residues`],
    ['04:37', `or just a fraction of the tolerance level.`],
    ['04:40', `Right now,`],
    ['04:41', `contamination from bacteria and fungi`],
    ['04:44', `is much more dangerous.`],
    ['04:45', `And, on this front,`],
    ['04:46', `the risk is the same --`],
    ['04:48', `be it organic or regular food.`],
    ['04:51', `Is organic food better for the environment?`],
    ['04:55', `In 2017, a meta-analysis`],
    ['04:58', `looked at organic farming in detail`],
    ['05:00', `and analyzed organic and regular foods`],
    ['05:02', `from over 700 production sources,`],
    ['05:04', `and their impact on categories like greenhouse gas emissions,`],
    ['05:07', `energy consumption,`],
    ['05:08', `and land needs.`],
    ['05:10', `The result?`],
    ['05:11', `No production method is clearly better for the environment.`],
    ['05:15', `Organic systems use less energy than conventional ones,`],
    ['05:18', `but have similar greenhouse gas emissions.`],
    ['05:21', `Organic farms use less pesticide,`],
    ['05:24', `but need much more land to produce the same amount of crop.`],
    ['05:28', `These mixed results were also confirmed`],
    ['05:30', `by a report from the Swedish food agency.`],
    ['05:33', `Organic and regular were equal in most regards.`],
    ['05:37', `The biggest difference was land use.`],
    ['05:39', `And here conventional farming clearly won,`],
    ['05:41', `and ecotoxicity`],
    ['05:43', `where organic farming has a clear advantage.`],
    ['05:47', `So, according to these results,`],
    ['05:48', `conventional farming`],
    ['05:50', `actually has a little bit less impact on the environment`],
    ['05:53', `compared to organic.`],
    ['05:55', `The bottom line is`],
    ['05:56', `organic food isn't superior to regular produce`],
    ['05:59', `as far as we know.`],
    ['06:01', `But, organic agriculture also has an impact at a broader level.`],
    ['06:05', `Demand is rising constantly,`],
    ['06:07', `and the struggle to supply the market`],
    ['06:09', `can lead to production methods that are less sustainable in other ways.`],
    ['06:13', `Spain, for example,`],
    ['06:14', `grows tons of regular and organic vegetables`],
    ['06:17', `destined for export`],
    ['06:18', `in vast greenhouse areas which use a lot of energy.`],
    ['06:21', `And have other environmental impacts,`],
    ['06:23', `such as significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions.`],
    ['06:27', `And, because growing demand can't be covered by domestic production,`],
    ['06:31', `the global trade and organic foods is also increasing.`],
    ['06:35', `As supply chains get more and more complex,`],
    ['06:38', `to make all kinds of foods available in organic quality,`],
    ['06:41', `ensuring organic quality standards`],
    ['06:43', `and regulations gets ever more difficult.`],
    ['06:46', `This has led to incidences of fraud`],
    ['06:49', `where conventional food was labeled and sold`],
    ['06:52', `as expensive organic produce.`],
    ['06:54', `But, organic versus conventional food`],
    ['06:57', `isn't even an objective discussion.`],
    ['07:00', `Organic is not simply a production method.`],
    ['07:03', `For many, it's an ideology.`],
    ['07:05', `Buying organic feels right.`],
    ['07:08', `People want to do the correct thing for the health of their children,`],
    ['07:11', `and the well-being of the planet.`],
    ['07:13', `But, our instinct to think of organic as good,`],
    ['07:17', `and conventional as bad,`],
    ['07:19', `can get in the way of making the most reasonable decision.`],
    ['07:23', `The solution could be to stop seeing organic`],
    ['07:26', `and conventional farming as irreconcilable.`],
    ['07:28', `They both have pros and cons,`],
    ['07:30', `and the best way to produce healthy food efficiently`],
    ['07:33', `would be a combination of their best features.`],
    ['07:36', `And,`],
    ['07:37', `as for your personal shopping,`],
    ['07:39', `what food you should buy`],
    ['07:41', `depends on what you expect from it.`],
    ['07:43', `If you simply want to eat healthily,`],
    ['07:46', `you should buy more fruit and vegies of any kind,`],
    ['07:48', `not necessarily organic.`],
    ['07:51', `If your concern is for the environment,`],
    ['07:53', `then simply buying organic won't solve this problem for you.`],
    ['07:57', `The easiest option,`],
    ['07:58', `is to buy local food that's in season.`],
    ['08:01', `Basically,`],
    ['08:02', `seasonal is the true organic.`],
    ['08:05', `To sum up,`],
    ['08:06', `an organic label is a manufacturing notice,`],
    ['08:09', `not a security certificate`],
    ['08:11', `or a silver bullet for your diet.`],
    ['08:14', `What you eat`],
    ['08:15', `is much more important than how its produced.`],
    ['08:20', `Production is very important for our animations though.`],
    ['08:23', `We make them with a lot of love and care,`],
    ['08:25', `and the best thing is`],
    ['08:26', `you can learn how to do them.`],
    ['08:28', `Kurzgesagt joined Skillshare,`],
    ['08:30', `our favorite online learning community for creators`],
