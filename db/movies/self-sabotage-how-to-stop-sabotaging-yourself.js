    ['00:06', `Hey everyone, welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:08', `It's Aileen.`],
    ['00:09', `Today, let's talk about self sabotage:`],
    ['00:12', `what it is and how to stop sabotaging yourself.`],
    ['00:15', `Self sabotage is when you hurt yourself`],
    ['00:19', `or when you hold yourself back from reaching your full potential`],
    ['00:23', `or reaching the next level of happiness or success that you desire in life.`],
    ['00:29', `Sometimes we do this without even realizing it,`],
    ['00:32', `because it's just an innate mental block that happens.`],
    ['00:36', `And other times you might realize that you're sabotaging yourself,`],
    ['00:38', `and yet you still do it.`],
    ['00:41', `You might know that you're emotionally eating`],
    ['00:43', `and yet you still want to do it, because you have that craving there,`],
    ['00:46', `or because you want to procrastinate or something.`],
    ['00:49', `So today I want to talk about how we can become`],
    ['00:51', `more aware of when we're sabotaging ourselves and how to stop doing it.`],
    ['00:56', `The foundation of why we tend to sabotage ourselves is this idea of comfort.`],
    ['01:02', `Humans love comfort.`],
    ['01:04', `You and I know we love to do what we're comfortable with.`],
    ['01:07', `We love to stay in what we know.`],
    ['01:10', `We don't like surprises.`],
    ['01:11', `We don't like anything too risky or uncertain.`],
    ['01:14', `We like to stay in the safe zone, this comfort zone.`],
    ['01:18', `And self sabotage is what happens when you are reaching the edge of that comfort zone.`],
    ['01:23', `Or maybe you've passed that comfort zone`],
    ['01:25', `and you have this mental part of you or the subconscious part of you that tells you,`],
    ['01:29', `“Okay, let's backtrack, let's hold it for a bit. Let's not go there.`],
    ['01:34', `Let me stay back here where it's safe.”`],
    ['01:36', `And so you do things that don't allow yourself to break through those boundaries`],
    ['01:42', `and break through whatever blocks you need to break through`],
    ['01:44', `in order to get to that next level of happiness and success or amazing things in life.`],
    ['01:49', `Basically, in each of our lives there's a certain level of happiness that we are comfortable with.`],
    ['01:55', `So you may be used to experiencing a certain level of happiness,`],
    ['01:59', `and you might think that you want more happiness,`],
    ['02:02', `but in the journey of getting there,`],
    ['02:05', `you need to push yourself outside of that level that you're comfortable with.`],
    ['02:09', `And it might just feel so weird to you that you innately sabotage yourself,`],
    ['02:13', `so you go back to that same level that you've always been comfortable with,`],
    ['02:17', `because it's uncomfortable and it's weird.`],
    ['02:19', `It's different and scary to push yourself`],
    ['02:21', `beyond what you know, what you're comfortable with.`],
    ['02:25', `So that is self sabotage.`],
    ['02:27', `A lot of the times, it's possible for you to have a higher level of happiness,`],
    ['02:31', `but you don't allow yourself to be that happy,`],
    ['02:35', `because it's so different from what you know.`],
    ['02:38', `And so, you tell yourself in your mind, things that don't allow yourself to be that happy.`],
    ['02:44', `You don't allow yourself to enjoy your success`],
    ['02:46', `because there's something in you that's holding you back.`],
    ['02:49', `I don't know if you've experienced that feeling`],
    ['02:51', `of not allowing yourself to be fully happy,`],
    ['02:55', `or that feeling of not allowing yourself to enjoy your successes`],
    ['02:58', `or appreciate your accomplishments that you made,`],
    ['03:01', `because it's so new and different for you.`],
    ['03:05', `You just don't allow yourself to feel it, you know.`],
    ['03:07', `Happiness is something you can choose to feel more of,`],
    ['03:10', `but a lot of people limit themselves because they're afraid.`],
    ['03:14', `It's out of their comfort zone to field that happy,`],
    ['03:16', `because they are used to their life, you know, operating within this range of happiness.`],
    ['03:21', `And you're also afraid that if you enjoy your success or you're too happy,`],
    ['03:25', `that you're going to fail and things are going to come falling down on you.`],
    ['03:29', `So it’s that fear of the unknown.`],
    ['03:30', `You don't want to get your hopes up,`],
    ['03:32', `and so you kind of just don't let yourself live to the fullest`],
    ['03:36', `and you're just enjoying life just “this much” rather than “that much”.`],
    ['03:39', `Not only is self sabotage about wanting to stay within your comfort zone,`],
    ['03:43', `it also has a lot to do with your self confidence`],
    ['03:46', `and how you see your own self and your self worth,`],
    ['03:50', `because you won't allow yourself to feel happy`],
    ['03:54', `if you don't believe you deserve it.`],
    ['03:56', `And the same thing goes for success and reaching goals.`],
    ['03:59', `You might think that you desire to succeed in this path.`],
    ['04:03', `You might desire to reach this goal`],
    ['04:05', `and maybe subconsciously in the back of your mind,`],
    ['04:08', `you don't feel like you're worthy of that goal`],
    ['04:11', `or you don't feel like you deserve it.`],
    ['04:13', `And in that case, you will always self sabotage yourself`],
    ['04:16', `and hold yourself back before you ever reach that goal.`],
    ['04:19', `It'll come in the form of procrastination, excuses,`],
    ['04:23', `wanting to give up, going on an emotional roller coaster,`],
    ['04:27', `not making a decision to fully commit, not deciding to focus 100%.`],
    ['04:33', `The reality is: A lot of the times, what stands between you`],
    ['04:36', `and what you want is a bunch of mental blocks.`],
    ['04:40', `It's not just about the taking action.`],
    ['04:43', `If we didn't have mental blocks, we would be like a computer.`],
    ['04:46', `We know, “Okay, we'll take this step and this step,`],
    ['04:48', `then this step, then this step, and then we're there.”`],
    ['04:50', `But the reality is: There's a lot of winding paths because we tend to overthink.`],
    ['04:55', `We tend to procrastinate.`],
    ['04:57', `Once we've reached a little bit of success,`],
    ['04:59', `it's so outside of our comfort zone that subconsciously, we try to pull ourselves back.`],
    ['05:04', `So you might find a little success and then after you find that success,`],
    ['05:07', `you mentally tell yourself, “Oh great. I did a little bit, now I can chill out. I can rest and whatever.”`],
    ['05:14', `So then you backtrack because you're not working as hard.`],
    ['05:17', `And that thought is your self sabotage.`],
    ['05:21', `It's because you are afraid of continuing to push at that same level,`],
    ['05:25', `because whether you think you don't deserve it`],
    ['05:27', `or whether it's just too strange and uncomfortable and different for you,`],
    ['05:31', `that you're like, “Okay, this is too different.`],
    ['05:33', `I need to backtrack to what I'm comfortable with.”`],
    ['05:35', `You are the one that ends up holding yourself back.`],
    ['05:38', `And that is what self-sabotage is.`],
    ['05:41', `So now that we understand more about self sabotage and why it happens,`],
    ['05:44', `what the root cause of it is and what it looks like...`],
    ['05:47', `How do we stop doing this?`],
    ['05:50', `How do we release these mental blocks?`],
    ['05:52', `How do we not be our own worst enemy as we're pursuing our goals and dreams?`],
    ['05:57', `So the first step is recognizing what's happening.`],
    ['06:00', `It's being aware of the ways that you self sabotage.`],
    ['06:04', `It's being aware that you feel resistant`],
    ['06:06', `when you're pushing outside of your comfort zone.`],
    ['06:09', `But you have to just logically know that what's outside of your comfort zone, it feels weird,`],
    ['06:14', `but it's good for you, so just be aware of that.`],
    ['06:17', `Pushing your comfort zone is just like working a muscle.`],
    ['06:20', `The more you do it, the more you practice,`],
    ['06:22', `the better and stronger you get.`],
    ['06:24', `You also got to work on your self worth`],
    ['06:26', `and believe that you deserve everything that you desire.`],
    ['06:30', `Believe that it is yours.`],
    ['06:31', `Believe that you can make it.`],
    ['06:33', `Believe you can achieve this goal`],
    ['06:34', `and believe that you are worthy of that goal.`],
    ['06:37', `You are worthy of what you desire,`],
    ['06:39', `and that is an internal belief that you have to have in order to get there,`],
    ['06:44', `because if you don't believe that you deserve it`],
    ['06:46', `or you don't believe that you're worthy of the goal,`],
    ['06:48', `no matter how hard you work towards it,`],
    ['06:49', `you're always going to find something that blocks you from reaching it.`],
    ['06:53', `So you have to really work on that self-worth.`],
    ['06:56', `The next thing you've got to do is learn to manage your fears,`],
    ['06:59', `to feel the fear and do it anyway,`],
    ['07:02', `because ultimately procrastination is a form of fear.`],
    ['07:06', `You procrastinate because you care about this thing so much that you're afraid to take action,`],
    ['07:11', `because you might mess it up.`],
    ['07:12', `You're afraid of messing it up.`],
    ['07:13', `You're afraid of failure.`],
    ['07:15', `So that is what procrastination and resistance really is.`],
    ['07:19', `It's all fear.`],
    ['07:21', `So you have to learn to manage your fears,`],
    ['07:23', `be aware of your fears, understand why you have them,`],
    ['07:26', `and then learn to take the action anyway.`],
    ['07:30', `And I'll talk more about fears in an upcoming video,`],
    ['07:32', `but there's also something I talked about previously called`],
    ['07:35', `“reducing that gap between knowing and doing”.`],
    ['07:39', `I'm talking about the gap between knowing what you gotta do and actually doing it.`],
    ['07:44', `The wider that gap is, the greater the discomfort.`],
    ['07:48', `Meaning the longer you take between knowing what you gotta do and doing it,`],
    ['07:52', `the more anguish and stress and negative feelings you're going to feel,`],
    ['07:58', `because that is your fear.`],
    ['08:00', `That gap is how long you are letting your fear control you, control your decisions,`],
    ['08:06', `and how much you procrastinate is also a sign of how strong your fear is.`],
    ['08:12', `So you've got to conquer that fear.`],
    ['08:14', `You got to manage it: Reduce that procrastination.`],
    ['08:17', `Just take action.`],
    ['08:18', `Like I said, it's all in your head.`],
    ['08:20', `The last thing you gotta do is just to keep going, keep pushing yourself.`],
    ['08:25', `And don't stop, don't give up.`],
    ['08:28', `A lot of self sabotage is just that thought that tells yourself,`],
    ['08:31', `“This is hard. I want to give up.”`],
    ['08:33', `Or it's that voice that, after you've achieved some level of success you're like,`],
    ['08:37', `“Okay, this might be good enough. I'm going to be lazy now.”`],
    ['08:40', `You know, it's that voice that doesn't want to do what's hard.`],
    ['08:43', `It’s that voice that is the weaker version of you.`],
    ['08:47', `And we all have the stronger and weaker versions of us,`],
    ['08:49', `so it's totally normal and okay.`],
    ['08:51', `But it's understanding that you are stronger than that weak voice that wants to give up.`],
    ['08:56', `It is your choice to decide which voice to listen to.`],
    ['09:00', `So let me know in the comments if you've noticed`],
    ['09:02', `any self sabotage happening in your journey.`],
    ['09:05', `Let me know what it looks like, what your self sabotage manifested into you,`],
    ['09:10', `because I'm really curious to read more examples on self-sabotage,`],
    ['09:14', `especially since it's something that not everyone realizes that they're doing.`],
    ['09:18', `Personally, for me it happens through procrastination,`],
    ['09:21', `when I have a big project and I'm just not letting myself face it.`],
    ['09:25', `And it also happens when I feel like I've worked really hard`],
    ['09:29', `and I've reached a certain level of success,`],
    ['09:30', `and then I get lazy because I don't want to work that hard for a bit.`],
    ['09:34', `And then I backtrack, so I'm not moving forward`],
    ['09:37', `or progressing as effectively as I could be`],
    ['09:40', `if I were just pushing myself at a consistent rate,`],
    ['09:43', `because I think there's something that is scary about growing so fast`],
    ['09:48', `or reaching a high level of success that you're not comfortable with,`],
    ['09:51', `because it's so new and you don't know it.`],
    ['09:53', `So because it's so new and different, you're like,`],
    ['09:56', `“Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's chill. Let's backtrack so I don't grow too fast."`],
    ['10:00', `And I know that that is self sabotage, because I'm not giving my best.`],
    ['10:04', `I'm not being the version of myself that's operating at her fullest potential.`],
    ['10:09', `I'm not being the most excellent that I can be.`],
    ['10:11', `I'm not putting like 1000% of hard work and effort,`],
    ['10:15', `and I know that the only person holding myself back is myself.`],
    ['10:20', `It's just me that's afraid to grow so fast`],
    ['10:22', `or me that's afraid to give it my all, every single day,`],
    ['10:25', `always doing my best, because you know what?`],
    ['10:27', `It's tiring.`],
    ['10:28', `It's tiring to do your best.`],
    ['10:30', `It's hard to push yourself outside of your comfort zone, but it's totally possible.`],
    ['10:35', `So instead of being afraid of that,`],
    ['10:37', `being afraid because it's so new or it's so difficult,`],
    ['10:39', `just allow yourself to receive and enjoy all the happiness,`],
    ['10:45', `success, and abundance in this world, because you deserve it.`],
    ['10:50', `Anything you desire, you deserve.`],
    ['10:52', `You are so worthy of everything that you want`],
    ['10:55', `and it is possible for it to happen for you.`],
    ['10:58', `So don't block yourself from achieving it.`],
    ['11:01', `Allow yourself to receive.`],
    ['11:03', `Allow yourself to be the best that you can be.`],
    ['11:06', `Stop self sabotaging yourself.`],
    ['11:08', `All right, love you so much.`],
    ['11:10', `I hope this was helpful.`],
    ['11:12', `It's still a journey for me,`],
    ['11:13', `but its first step is being aware of what's happening, right?`],
    ['11:16', `All right, that's it for today.`],
    ['11:18', `Love you so much and I will see you next time.`],
    ['11:20', `Bye!`]
