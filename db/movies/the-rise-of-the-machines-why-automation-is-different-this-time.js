    ['00:03', `before machines do your job better than you do?`],
    ['00:07', `Automation used to mean big stupid machines doing repetitive work in factories.`],
    ['00:11', `Today they can land aircraft, diagnose cancer and trade stocks.`],
    ['00:16', `We are entering a new age of automation unlike anything that's come before.`],
    ['00:21', `According to a 2013 study, almost half of all jobs in the`],
    ['00:24', `US could potentially be automated in the next two decades.`],
    ['00:28', `But wait; Hasn't automation been around for decades?`],
    ['00:31', `What's different this time?`],
    ['00:46', `Things used to be simple.`],
    ['00:49', `Innovation made human work easier and productivity rose.`],
    ['00:52', `Which means that more staff or services could be produced`],
    ['00:55', `per hour using the same amount of human workers.`],
    ['00:58', `This eliminated many jobs, but also created other jobs that were better`],
    ['01:02', `which was important because the growing population needed work.`],
    ['01:06', `So, in a nutshell, innovation, higher productivity,`],
    ['01:10', `fewer old jobs, and many new and often better jobs.`],
    ['01:15', `Overall, this worked well for a majority of people and living standards improved.`],
    ['01:21', `There's a clear progression in terms of what humans did for`],
    ['01:24', `a living. For the longest time, we worked in agriculture.`],
    ['01:27', `With the Industrial Revolution, this shift into production jobs and as`],
    ['01:31', `automation became more widespread, humans shifted into service jobs.`],
    ['01:37', `And then only a few moments ago in human history, the Information Age happened.`],
    ['01:41', `Suddenly, the rules were different. Our jobs are now being`],
    ['01:45', `taken over by machines much faster than they were in the past.`],
    ['01:49', `That's worrying of course... but innovation will clearly save us, right?`],
    ['01:54', `While new information age industries are booming,`],
    ['01:56', `they are creating fewer and fewer new jobs.`],
    ['02:00', `In 1979, General Motors employed more than 800,000`],
    ['02:04', `workers and made about $11 billion US dollars.`],
    ['02:08', `In 2012, Google made about $14 billion US dollars while employing 58,000 people.`],
    ['02:15', `You may not like this comparison, but Google is`],
    ['02:17', `an example of what created new jobs in the past:`],
    ['02:20', `Innovative new industries.`],
    ['02:23', `Old innovative industries are running out of steam. Just look at cars.`],
    ['02:27', `When they became a thing 100 years ago, they created huge industries.`],
    ['02:32', `Cars transformed our way of life, our infrastructure, and our cities.`],
    ['02:37', `Millions of people found jobs either directly or indirectly.`],
    ['02:41', `Decades of investment kept this momentum going.`],
    ['02:44', `Today, this process is largely complete. Innovation in the`],
    ['02:48', `car industry does not create as many jobs as it used to.`],
    ['02:52', `While electric cars are great and all, they won't create millions of new jobs.`],
    ['02:57', `But wait; what about the internet?`],
    ['03:00', `Some technologists argue that the Internet is an`],
    ['03:02', `innovation on a par of the introduction of electricity.`],
    ['03:06', `If we go with this comparison, we see how our`],
    ['03:09', `modern innovation differs from the old one.`],
    ['03:11', `The Internet created new industries,`],
    ['03:13', `but they're not creating enough jobs to keep up`],
    ['03:15', `with population growth or to compensate for the industries the Internet is killing.`],
    ['03:20', `At its peak in 2004,`],
    ['03:22', `Blockbuster had 84,000 employees and made $6 billion US dollars in revenue.`],
    ['03:28', `In 2016, Netflix had 4,500 employees and made $9 billion dollars in revenue.`],
    ['03:35', `Or take us, for example.`],
    ['03:36', `With a full-time team of just 12 people, Kurzgesagt reaches millions of people.`],
    ['03:41', `A TV station with the same amount of viewers needs way more employees.`],
    ['03:46', `Innovation in the Information Age doesn't equate to`],
    ['03:48', `the creation of enough new jobs, which would be bad`],
    ['03:51', `enough on its own but now, a new wave of automation and`],
    ['03:55', `a new generation of machines is slowly taking over.`],
    ['04:03', `To understand this, we need to understand ourselves first.`],
    ['04:07', `Human progress is based on the division of labor.`],
    ['04:10', `As we advanced over thousands of years, our jobs became more and more specialized.`],
    ['04:16', `While even our smartest machines are bad at doing complicated jobs,`],
    ['04:20', `they are extremely good at doing narrowly defined and predictable tasks.`],
    ['04:25', `This is what destroyed factory jobs.`],
    ['04:28', `But look at a complex job long and hard enough,`],
    ['04:30', `and you'll find that it's really just many narrowly`],
    ['04:33', `defined and predictable tasks one after another.`],
    ['04:37', `Machines are on the brink of becoming so good at`],
    ['04:39', `breaking down complex jobs into many predictable ones,`],
    ['04:42', `that for a lot of people, there will be no further room to specialize.`],
    ['04:46', `We are on the verge of being outcompeted.`],
    ['04:51', `Digital machines do this via machine learning,`],
    ['04:53', `which enables them to acquire information and skills by analyzing data.`],
    ['04:58', `This makes them become better at something through the relationships they discover.`],
    ['05:02', `Machines teach themselves.`],
    ['05:04', `We make this possible by giving a computer a lot of`],
    ['05:07', `data about the thing we wanted to become better at.`],
    ['05:10', `Show a machine all the things you bought online,`],
    ['05:12', `and it will slowly learn what to recommend to you, so you buy more things.`],
    ['05:18', `Machine learning is now meeting more of its potential because in recent years,`],
    ['05:22', `humans have started to gather data about everything.`],
    ['05:26', `Behavior, weather patterns, medical records, communication systems,`],
    ['05:31', `travel data, and of course, data about what we do at work.`],
    ['05:36', `What we've created by accident is a huge library machines can`],
    ['05:40', `use to learn how humans do things and learn to do them better.`],
    ['05:45', `These digital machines might be the biggest job killer of all.`],
    ['05:48', `They can be replicated instantly and for free.`],
    ['05:52', `When they improve, you don't need to invest in`],
    ['05:54', `big metal things; you can just use the new code.`],
    ['05:58', `And they have the ability to get better fast. How fast?`],
    ['06:03', `If your work involves complex work on a computer today, you might be out`],
    ['06:07', `of work even sooner than the people who still have jobs in factories.`],
    ['06:11', `There are actual real-world examples of how this transition might be happening.`],
    ['06:17', `A San Francisco company offers a project management software for big`],
    ['06:20', `corporations, which is supposed to eliminate middle management positions.`],
    ['06:25', `When it's hired for a new project, the software first decides which jobs`],
    ['06:28', `can be automated and precisely where it needs actual professional humans.`],
    ['06:34', `It then helps assemble a team of freelancers over the Internet.`],
    ['06:38', `The software then distributes tasks to the humans, and controls the quality`],
    ['06:41', `of the work, tracking individual performance until the project is complete.`],
    ['06:46', `Okay. This doesn't sound too bad.`],
    ['06:49', `While this machine is killing one job, it creates jobs for freelancers, right?`],
    ['06:54', `Well, as the freelancers complete their tasks,`],
    ['06:57', `learning algorithms track them, and gather data`],
    ['06:59', `about their work, and which tasks it consists of.`],
    ['07:03', `So what's actually happening, is that`],
    ['07:04', `the freelancers are teaching a machine how to replace them.`],
    ['07:08', `On average, this software reduces costs by about 50%`],
    ['07:12', `in the first year, and by another 25% in the second year.`],
    ['07:16', `This is only one example of many.`],
    ['07:19', `There are machines and programs getting as good`],
    ['07:22', `or better than humans in all kinds of fields.`],
    ['07:25', `From pharmacists to analysts, journalists to radiologists,`],
    ['07:29', `cashiers to bank tellers, or the unskilled worker flipping burgers.`],
    ['07:34', `All of these jobs won't disappear overnight,`],
    ['07:36', `but fewer and fewer humans will be doing them.`],
    ['07:39', `We'll discuss a few cases in a follow-up video.`],
    ['07:42', `But while jobs disappearing is bad, it's only half of the story.`],
    ['07:52', `It's not enough to substitute old jobs with new ones.`],
    ['07:55', `We need to be generating new jobs constantly`],
    ['07:57', `because the world population is growing.`],
    ['08:00', `In the past we have solved this through innovation.`],
    ['08:03', `But, since 1973, the generation of new jobs in the US has begun to shrink.`],
    ['08:09', `And the first decade of the 21st century, was the first one, where`],
    ['08:12', `the total amount of jobs in the US, did not grow for the first time.`],
    ['08:17', `In a country that needs to create up to 150,000 new jobs per`],
    ['08:21', `month, just to keep up with population growth, this is bad news.`],
    ['08:26', `This is also starting to affect standards of living.`],
    ['08:30', `In the past, it was seen as obvious that with rising`],
    ['08:32', `productivity, more and better jobs would be created.`],
    ['08:36', `But the numbers tell a different story.`],
    ['08:39', `In 1998, US workers worked a total of 194 billion hours.`],
    ['08:45', `Over the course of the next 15 years, their output increased by 42 percent.`],
    ['08:50', `But in 2013, the amount of hours worked by US workers was still 194 billion hours.`],
    ['08:58', `What this means, is that despite productivity growing`],
    ['09:01', `drastically, thousands of new businesses opening up, and the`],
    ['09:04', `US population growing by over 40 million, there was no`],
    ['09:08', `growth at all in the number of hours worked in 15 years.`],
    ['09:12', `At the same time, wages for new university graduates`],
    ['09:15', `in the US, have been declining for the past decade,`],
    ['09:18', `while up to 40 percent of new graduates, are forced`],
    ['09:21', `to take on jobs that don't require a degree.`],
    ['09:29', `Productivity is separating from human labor.`],
    ['09:33', `The nature of innovation in the Information Age is`],
    ['09:35', `different from everything we've encountered before.`],
    ['09:38', `This process started years ago and is already well underway.`],
    ['09:43', `Even without new disruptions like self-driving cars, or robot accountants.`],
    ['09:49', `It looks like automation is different this time.`],
    ['09:52', `This time, the machines might really take our jobs.`],
    ['09:56', `Our economies are based on the premise that people consume.`],
    ['09:59', `But if fewer and fewer people have decent work, who will be doing all the consuming?`],
    ['10:04', `Are we producing ever more cheaply only to arrive at a point where`],
    ['10:08', `too few people can actually buy all our stuff and services?`],
    ['10:12', `Or, will the future see a tiny minority of the super rich who own the machines...`],
    ['10:17', `dominating the rest of us?`],
    ['10:18', `And does our future really have to be that grim?`],
    ['10:22', `While we were fairly dark in this video, it's far`],
    ['10:24', `from certain that things will turn out negatively.`],
    ['10:27', `The Information Age and modern automation, could be a huge opportunity`],
    ['10:31', `to change human society, and reduce poverty and inequality drastically.`],
    ['10:36', `It could be a seminal moment in human history.`],
    ['10:39', `We'll talk about this potential, and possible solutions like`],
    ['10:42', `a universal basic income, in part 2 of this video series.`],
    ['10:46', `We need to think big, and fast.`],
    ['10:49', `Because one thing's for sure, the machines are not coming;`],
    ['10:53', `They are already here.`],
    ['10:57', `This video took us about 900 hours to make,`],
    ['10:59', `and we've been working on it for over nine months.`],
    ['11:02', `Projects like this one would not be possible`],
    ['11:04', `without your support on patreon.com.`],
    ['11:06', `If you want to help us out and get a personal`],
    ['11:08', `Kurzgesagt bird in return, that would be really useful.`],
    ['11:11', `We based much of this video on two very good books:`],

    ['11:21', `Also, we made a little robot poster.`],
