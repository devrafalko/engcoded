    ['00:00', `This episode of Real Engineering is brought to you by Brilliant, a problem solving website`],
    ['00:04', `that teaches you to think like an engineer.`],
    ['00:07', `One of the biggest challenges facing mankind today is our quest to transition to renewable`],
    ['00:13', `energy. Overhauling our entire electricity grid requires drastic changes to be made in`],
    ['00:19', `the way we produce, transport, use and store electricity. We have explored in past videos,`],
    ['00:26', `that with the lowering cost of solar and wind, we are beginning to hit a point of imbalance`],
    ['00:30', `in the grid. Where places like California are wasting massive amounts of energy in the`],
    ['00:35', `summer months, when solar is at its peak and not producing enough in the winter. To deal`],
    ['00:40', `with this problem California is now installing gigantic battery storage facilities in places`],
    ['00:46', `like Moss Landing to store that excess for later use, but the amount of battery storage`],
    ['00:51', `that they will require as our percentage of renewables increases is going to cost the`],
    ['00:56', `state billions, if not trillions.`],
    ['00:59', `We could drastically decrease this dependence on batteries, if we could find a nice stable`],
    ['01:05', `energy source that did not harm our planet. Some want to turn to nuclear energy, but what`],
    ['01:11', `if I told you the solution may be lying directly under our feet.`],
    ['01:15', `Imagine an ancient, hidden energy source, deep within every square meter of our planet’s`],
    ['01:21', `surface. It’s clean, flexible, virtually limitless, completely renewable, never turns`],
    ['01:27', `off and virtually carbon free. Geothermal energy, the energy produced by the earth itself`],
    ['01:30', `in the form of heat, can be that solution.`],
    ['01:31', `Geothermal energy is produced by the Earth’s inherent heat. The center of the earth (On`],
    ['01:34', `screen: 6500km deep) is as hot as the surface of the sun (6000 °C). Through convection,`],
    ['01:38', `that heat warms the outer layers of the planet. But where does this heat come from? Much of`],
    ['01:43', `it comes from gravitational forces when the planet first form 4 billion years ago, some`],
    ['01:48', `heat is generated from friction as denser elements make their way to the earth's core.`],
    ['01:53', `The other source of Earth’s internal heat occurs in the upper mantle and crust, where`],
    ['01:57', `the decay of radioactive isotopes, like Potassium-40, creates energy, and in turn, heat. If we could`],
    ['02:04', `find a way to safely and cost effectively access that heat our energy problems would`],
    ['02:09', `be solved in years.`],
    ['02:11', `That heat does come to the surface in some easily accessible locations. At temperatures`],
    ['02:16', `of 700 °C or more, rocks become partially melted, becoming magma, driving a variety`],
    ['02:22', `of geothermal phenomena. If magma flowing underground heats gases or water it can create`],
    ['02:28', `bubbling hot springs and geysers, undersea hot vents, and natural steam vents. These`],
    ['02:33', `features can provide water that’s more than 200 °C, more than enough to run a steam turbine.`],
    ['02:40', `Geothermal hot spots like this are found near the boundaries of tectonic plates, like Iceland,`],
    ['02:45', `in volcanically active areas, like Turkey, or in some places where Earth’s crust is`],
    ['02:50', `thin, like America’s Yellowstone National Park. These places provide low hanging fruit`],
    ['02:56', `to harvest the earth’s heat for our energy needs.`],
    ['02:59', `Each year enough heat flows (44 TWth) to the planet’s surface to meet total global energy`],
    ['03:04', `consumption twice over [1]. And the geothermal reservoir is boundless: heat within 10km of`],
    ['03:11', `Earth's surface contains roughly 50,000 times more energy than all fossil fuel resources`],
    ['03:17', `worldwide [2].`],
    ['03:19', `Yet geothermal energy makes up less than 1% of global installed electricity capacity.`],
    ['03:25', `This isn’t even a technology issue, of the global potential for geothermal power using`],
    ['03:31', `off-the-shelf technology, only 7% has been tapped [3]. So in the fight to transform our`],
    ['03:37', `global energy system, why haven’t we adopted this energy source in a serious way?`],
    ['03:42', `Let’s first look at our low hanging fruit, that are not being used to their full potential.`],
    ['03:48', `Naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs feature hot water that percolates near the`],
    ['03:53', `surface through porous or cracked rock layers. This is the easiest form of geothermal energy`],
    ['03:59', `to harvest, and can be tapped in several ways, which we have been doing for centuries.`],
    ['04:05', `Human societies have used the heat from low-temperature (150 °C) geothermal energy for millennia.`],
    ['04:10', `Among the most famous examples may be the hot springs of Bath, England, established`],
    ['04:15', `by Roman engineers in 60 CE. Here 1 million litres of water percolate to the city centre`],
    ['04:22', `of bath every day at a temperature of about 45 degrees, heating recreational baths and`],
    ['04:28', `heating some buildings. This hot water replenishes itself as rain that falls in nearby hills`],
    ['04:34', `seeps through porous limestone deep underground where it is heated and rises back to the surface.`],
    ['04:40', `[4]`],
    ['04:41', `But convenient locations like this where the right combination of a water cycle, with porous`],
    ['04:46', `rocks underground and a heat source close enough to the surface to heat it, are rare,`],
    ['04:51', `and ones that can provide water with enough heat and pressure to run a steam turbine are`],
    ['04:57', `even rarer. This particular source is not suitable, as 45 degrees is far off the lowest`],
    ['05:03', `temperature we can employ.`],
    ['05:05', `There are three basic types of geothermal energy generators. All three share the same`],
    ['05:10', `basic idea. Take hot water or steam from a geothermal reservoir`],
    ['05:15', `and run it through a steam turbine where it loses energy and condenses before being pumped`],
    ['05:20', `back underground to keep the cycle going. Dry Steam generators take the steam directly`],
    ['05:25', `from the source to run a turbine. A flash steam power plant takes extremely hot water`],
    ['05:31', `under pressure above 100 degrees, and expands it quickly to lower its boiling point and`],
    ['05:36', `turn it steam to run the steam turbine.`],
    ['05:39', `These both require higher temperature sources that are rare, [5] but they are relatively`],
    ['05:44', `common in geothermally active regions like Iceland, Italy, Austria and around the Pacific`],
    ['05:50', `ring of fire, and in these locations geothermal energy is common and is expected to grow as`],
    ['05:56', `much at 28% in the next 4 years, with countries in South East Asia expected to see the largest`],
    ['06:03', `growths like Indonesia and the Philippines. [6]`],
    ['06:06', `But we want to exploit geothermal energy outside of these regions. No matter how much power`],
    ['06:11', `we can extract we can’t transport it far before power losses due to resistance in the`],
    ['06:16', `cables saps it away. The third type of generator provides the highest potential for expanding`],
    ['06:22', `geothermal energy as it can utilise the lowest temperature sources.`],
    ['06:26', `This system is called a binary cycle system. In a binary cycle power plant, warm water`],
    ['06:32', `from a geothermal source passes through a heat exchanger where it exchanges heat with`],
    ['06:37', `a closed loop containing a fluid with a low boiling point, like pentane, which has a boiling`],
    ['06:42', `point of 36 degrees. The lower boiling point allows it to transition to a gas at a much`],
    ['06:48', `lower temperature, allowing it to run a turbine at a lower temperature.`],
    ['06:53', `This system has allowed countries like Germany [7], which lacks any shallow depth geothermal`],
    ['06:58', `resources, to grow their geothermal energy market in recent years with temperatures as`],
    ['07:02', `low as 100 degrees celsius being utilised. That figure is important, because the higher`],
    ['07:08', `the temperature the deeper we have to drill.`],
    ['07:11', `Different areas have different geothermal gradients, which is a measure of how quickly`],
    ['07:15', `temperatures rise as we drill down. This map shows a rough estimate of the geothermal gradient`],
    ['07:21', `across the US [8], with the highest gradients being found in Oregan and Idaho reaching as`],
    ['07:26', `high as 70 degrees per kilometre. This is important, as to access this heat in areas`],
    ['07:32', `where it doesn’t naturally come to the surface in an accessible way we need to drill down`],
    ['07:37', `and the further down we need to drill the more expensive it becomes.`],
    ['07:41', `Typically we have only used geothermal resources where the natural permeability of the rock`],
    ['07:47', `allows a convective heat cycle, but a new technology by the name of Enhanced Geothermal`],
    ['07:52', `Systems or EGS, may open the door to geothermal energy to more regions.`],
    ['07:58', `It works like this. The first step is to drill an injection well into a formation of hot`],
    ['08:03', `rocks. Then engineers inject fluid at pressure to form cracks or enlarge existing ones, this`],
    ['08:10', `increases the area over which heat exchange with the rocks can occur. To increase this`],
    ['08:15', `area even further a non-toxic and degradable material is pumped down to fill these cracks`],
    ['08:21', `and allow the pressure to form new cracks as we drill further down. Once we have opened`],
    ['08:26', `an adequate number of passages for the water to fill we can drill additional holes that`],
    ['08:31', `can take act as an outlet for our hot water as we pump more underground.`],
    ['08:35', `A report by MIT in 2006 [9] found that EGS could provide electricity at a cost as low`],
    ['08:42', `as 3.9 cents per kilowatt hour, roughly equivalent to a coal-fired power plant. The United States`],
    ['08:49', `government estimates [10] that new geothermal power plants could produce 60 gigawatts of`],
    ['08:54', `electric power on American soil by 2050, mostly through EGS systems.`],
    ['09:00', `Now I know what you are thinking, this sounds a lot like the controversial practice of fracking,`],
    ['09:04', `but it doesn’t use toxic fracking fluid which can seep into our water cycle, it uses`],
    ['09:10', `water and some safe additives, but it’s not all plain sailing. [11] To make this work`],
    ['09:15', `we need to create great volumes of fractures and cracks and this can have some disastrous`],
    ['09:21', `consequences.`],
    ['09:22', `In 2017 drilling at a proposed site for EGS in Pohang, South Korea [12], is thought to`],
    ['09:27', `have triggered an earthquake of 5.4 magnitude that injured 135 people. A previous incident`],
    ['09:34', `occurred at an EGS plant in Basel, Switzerland in 2006, when drilling may have caused a quake`],
    ['09:41', `of magnitude 3.4, and several buildings were damaged. Both projects were cancelled as a`],
    ['09:47', `result.`],
    ['09:48', `Red tape is a huge obstacle for Geothermal Energy. In the United States, for example,`],
    ['09:53', `there’s less environmental paperwork and fewer approvals required for drilling for`],
    ['09:58', `oil than drilling a geothermal well. Tax credits for wind and solar power project are 30% while`],
    ['10:05', `the tax credit for geothermal is only 10%. [13]`],
    ['10:08', `On top of all this, drilling is very expensive and as we have seen doesn’t guarantee a`],
    ['10:14', `successful geothermal plant. You could waste months of your time digging a 2 kilometre`],
    ['10:19', `hole in the ground and the productivity of the well could be too small to make the project`],
    ['10:24', `worthwhile. That makes it difficult to find investors willing to bet their money on it.`],
    ['10:29', `It simply makes more sense to invest in solar and wind.`],
    ['10:32', `Despite the challenges, there’s real hope for expanding geothermal energy. The industry`],
    ['10:37', `can build off of recent improvements in drilling technology. [14] Engineers are developing`],
    ['10:42', `new kinds of drills for geothermal wells, and better techniques for cementing wells`],
    ['10:46', `drilled into hot rocks. The earthquake risk is real, but engineers have protocols for`],
    ['10:52', `monitoring with seismometers to ensure that the seismic risk can be assessed early on.`],
    ['10:58', `In the case of the Basel accident, the EGS facility was located over a seismic fault,`],
    ['11:03', `due to the proximity of hot rocks to the surface. Once the shaking started, fluid injection`],
    ['11:09', `was halted immediately. So far, geothermal projects haven’t attracted strong political`],
    ['11:14', `support in the West, but they also haven’t drawn major opposition, suggesting that easing`],
    ['11:20', `permitting rules for the technology may not be so challenging. As commercial interest`],
    ['11:26', `in this clean energy source rises, political support for it should follow, especially if`],
    ['11:32', `some smart politician realises it can be a rallying call for getting out of work oil`],
    ['11:37', `drilling techs back to work.`],
    ['11:40', `Sometimes the struggle to convert the global energy system to renewables can seem out of`],
    ['11:45', `reach and feel hopeless. But in the case of geothermal energy, there’s an exciting source`],
    ['11:50', `of electricity and heat that could power our future, and it’s right below our feet.`],
    ['11:56', `As I said at the start of the video, much of the energy present within earth is formed`],
    ['12:01', `as a result of gravitational forces. You can learn everything gravity is capable of by`],
