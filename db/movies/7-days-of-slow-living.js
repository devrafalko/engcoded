    ['00:00', `Recently Robin asked me if you could have any superpower in the world`],
    ['00:02', `What would you choose and without even needing to think about it?`],
    ['00:05', `my answer was`],
    ['00:06', `To slow down time because I constantly feel like there's so much that I want to do and there just are not enough hours in`],
    ['00:12', `The day to get it all done`],
    ['00:14', `And to top it all off this last week`],
    ['00:17', `I was pretty sick with a cold which you can probably still hear and`],
    ['00:21', `It really forced me to slow down and I feel like I also had it coming because I was just constantly`],
    ['00:26', `Go-go-go and I feel like nine times out of ten to you ask somebody how they're doing and their answer is I'm good`],
    ['00:32', `I'm busy like busy has just become such a norm`],
    ['00:34', `But if you feel like you have been affected by busyness either mentally or emotionally or like me physically`],
    ['00:41', `Then let's do something about it. We're gonna practice seven days of slow living retaliating against the rat race, but still getting things done`],
    ['00:48', `It's more just about living mindfully if you'd like. There's a PDF to help guide you along`],
    ['00:53', `You can get the link in the description box below. But for now, let's delve into each day one by one`],
    ['01:01', `For day one we're gonna keep it really light and simple just tuning in to the senses`],
    ['01:06', `So go about the business you normally would the only thing is we're in a conscious we try to tap in to any physical`],
    ['01:12', `Sensations like can you hear the ambient noises around you? Can you really feel the things that are in your hands?`],
    ['01:18', `What do you smell? What do you see?`],
    ['01:21', `Can you notice the fine?`],
    ['01:22', `Details of things that are around you this exercise is quite easily the quickest way I can ever bring myself into a slow living mindset`],
    ['01:30', `Just immersing all of my senses into the present moment`],
    ['01:37', `A lot of us take shallow breaths throughout the day. They feel like the more anxious and overwhelmed`],
    ['01:41', `We become the more rapid and shallow those breaths also tend to become so for today's challenge`],
    ['01:47', `We're going to anytime`],
    ['01:49', `We notice the breath try to consciously breathe a little bit more deeply one exercise to try is called square`],
    ['01:55', `Breathing where we just breathe through our nose for a count to hor`],
    ['01:58', `Hold for a count of four then exhale through the mouth for a count of four and hold for a count of four again`],
    ['02:04', `And then repeat after a minute just take a moment to pause and bring awareness to the body`],
    ['02:10', `What do you feel?`],
    ['02:11', `Is there any lightness?`],
    ['02:12', `Is there any tensing and if so, and if you need it?`],
    ['02:14', `Feel free to go ahead and give yourself a little stretch or massage before getting back to whatever it is you were doing`],
    ['02:24', `For day three, I think you guys are gonna love this one. We're gonna bring our attention to food today`],
    ['02:29', `Especially we're gonna focus on staying hydrated and making food choices that nourish the body`],
    ['02:35', `we're gonna really try to be in the moment from the beginning to the end from`],
    ['02:39', `washing vegetables`],
    ['02:40', `to cutting things up from noticing the colors of the`],
    ['02:43', `Spices to the steam coming off the food as it's being cooked and as a bonus slow living exercise today`],
    ['02:49', `we're gonna really take our time to plate the food as if we were serving that dish to ourselves at a`],
    ['02:54', `Restaurant and you know how sometimes you've only just put food in your mouth and already you're scooping up the next bite`],
    ['02:59', `Getting ready for it to go in right afterwards. Yeah, we're not gonna do that today today`],
    ['03:04', `We're gonna sit and enjoy and savor every bite`],
    ['03:07', `Trying to pay close attention to how it tastes and how it feels in your mouth and when it's finished`],
    ['03:12', `That's when we can scoop up the next bite and the same process holds for making our coffee or tea`],
    ['03:17', `It can be a rewarding experience`],
    ['03:20', `Just going slow pouring and tuning into the senses`],
    ['03:25', `I`],
    ['03:27', `Personally find it really hard to mentally slow down and feel come when my space is really cluttered`],
    ['03:32', `My mom always used to say busy space busy mine`],
    ['03:35', `So for today's slow living exercise`],
    ['03:38', `We're gonna take some time to create space clearing things off surfaces doing a good old wipe down`],
    ['03:44', `Heck even treating ourselves to some flowers because why not but here's the thing while we do the cleaning decluttering and organizing`],
    ['03:51', `We aren't just gonna do it quickly just to get it over with`],
    ['03:53', `We're gonna really immerse ourselves in it feeling the motions of sweeping the floor what muscles are activated when we clean off the table`],
    ['04:01', `What temperature is the water when we clean the dishes then have a seat and bask in the inviting space you've created?`],
    ['04:12', `Sometimes when we live life in its fast pace`],
    ['04:14', `It becomes really easy to take things for granted`],
    ['04:16', `We get frustrated when we lose our Wi-Fi reception`],
    ['04:19', `overwhelmed when we get stuck in traffic we get`],
    ['04:22', `Annoyed when our co-workers or friends or family call us because they need something and I know we all pay lip service`],
    ['04:27', `Sometimes to being grateful for things like our health and our loved ones. But today we're gonna take it to a whole new level`],
    ['04:34', `Finding gratitude in the simplest things things. We don't even usually give a second thought like grateful`],
    ['04:40', `There's a postal worker who just delivers things to us`],
    ['04:43', `And there's someone out there picking fruits and vegetables for us to enjoy and how cool is it that we have?`],
    ['04:48', `Electricity available on demand or that we can FaceTime with someone from halfway across the world`],
    ['04:53', `Within seconds and on top of being extra grateful today`],
    ['04:57', `We're also gonna practice`],
    ['04:58', `extra compassion making time to talk to someone instead of just`],
    ['05:02', `rushing through a conversation`],
    ['05:04', `Because we feel busy or making time to call a loved one or a friend just to say hi`],
    ['05:09', `And that was the only reason we called`],
    ['05:11', `Today is all about slowing it down to appreciate the small things the things we can sometimes take for granted`],
    ['05:20', `Sounds are around us all the time, but I don't think we realized just how much they can implicitly affect our mood`],
    ['05:26', `So for today's exercise we are going to use audio to slow things down`],
    ['05:31', `Removing any sounds that bring about a feeling of tension and replacing them with sounds that bring about a feeling of calmness`],
    ['05:37', `for example`],
    ['05:38', `We can change our morning alarm to something`],
    ['05:40', `That's more pleasant or listen to some ambient music that boosts our mood while we work or study and if your phone's notification`],
    ['05:47', `Sound grates on your nerves each time you hear it then today is the day we're gonna change it to something`],
    ['05:52', `We enjoy hearing and when we get home from work or school`],
    ['05:55', `We can play some relaxing tunes or unwind with an audio book one book. I keep going back to over and over`],
    ['06:02', `It's one of my all-time favorites is the book The Alchemist by Paulo, Coelho`],
    ['06:06', `it's an incredible story about a boy who has these recurring dreams of finding hidden treasures near the pyramids of Egypt and he`],
    ['06:13', `takes off on this journey and along the way learns a whole bunch of valuable life lessons and`],
    ['06:18', `As much as I love the story itself, what makes it even more enjoyable is the voice of the narrator?`],
    ['06:24', `You'll know it when you hear it. It's just the most calming thing ever to hear him speak`],
    ['06:28', `So I want to thank audible for partnering with us on today's video`],
    ['06:31', `And if you'd like you can get this book`],
    ['06:33', `Which I definitely recommend or any other book of your choosing absolutely for free in addition to a 30-day free membership by visiting audible.com`],
    ['06:40', `forward slash pick up lines or see the link in the description box below`],
    ['06:46', `And`],
    ['06:47', `Finally for day seven, we focus and bring our attention to the most important thing of them all`],
    ['06:52', `We schedule all sorts of things into our calendars appointments deadlines date nights with friends`],
    ['06:57', `But we don't as commonly scheduled in a block of time for ourselves. So that's what we're gonna do today`],
    ['07:03', `You're gonna set aside some uninterrupted time just for you`],
    ['07:07', `Whether it's for grooming or a bubble bath some yoga or a little walk in nature`],
    ['07:12', `It's whatever makes you feel happy and calm and grounded`],
    ['07:15', `You deserve this time more so than anyone else deserves your time`],
    ['07:20', `And after this week of slow living you might start to notice you pick up a few of the activities`],
    ['07:25', `Spontaneously from time to time and that's the most rewarding experience of all knowing that you can tap into mindfulness into the present moment`],
    ['07:34', `Into slow and intentional living at any second`],
    ['07:37', `things have a way of always feeling busy and time has a way of just flying by but tapping into the present moment and`],
    ['07:44', `Living intentionally really helps to slow things down and it really is like having a superpower`],
    ['07:50', `Thanks a lot for watching and for putting up with me sounding a bit congested`],
    ['07:54', `Hopefully it'll be gone for the next video`],
    ['07:55', `But there's nothing like getting sick to remind us that we can slow things down`],
    ['08:00', `If you enjoyed today's video it always means a lot when you give it a thumbs up`],
    ['08:03', `remember to grab that PDF link is in description and`],
    ['08:06', `Pick up lime signing off. We'll see you in the next video`]
