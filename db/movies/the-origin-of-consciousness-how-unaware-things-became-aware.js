    ['00:00', `Consciousness is perhaps the biggest riddle in nature.`],
    ['00:04', `Stripped to its core meaning,`],
    ['00:06', `consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state.`],
    ['00:12', `But thinking about consciousness has this habit of taking us round in circles.`],
    ['00:18', `We all intuitively know what consciousness is.`],
    ['00:21', `It's this...`],
    ['00:23', `It's what you're experiencing here, right now.`],
    ['00:27', `But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is, it leaves us grasping at thin air.`],
    ['00:34', `And not just us, philosophers and scientists struggle to define consciousness.`],
    ['00:40', `Different schools and ideas compete with one another, but no one has come close to figuring it out.`],
    ['00:46', `It's unsettling to realise that we don't understand what makes us aware of ourselves and the world.`],
    ['00:54', `In this fuzzy area, consciousness and intelligence are also related, although they are not the same.`],
    ['01:01', `We'll talk in greater depth about theories of consciousness and intelligence in other videos.`],
    ['01:07', `Like much of what makes us human,`],
    ['01:09', `our consciousness is likely to have evolved from less complex forms,`],
    ['01:13', `as a product of evolution by natural selection.`],
    ['01:17', `It has probably emerged from an immense several 100 million years sequence of countless micro steps,`],
    ['01:23', `that together make up a sort of gradient of consciousness.`],
    ['01:27', `What was the first step on this path from the non-conscious`],
    ['01:31', `to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today?`],
    ['01:38', `[Intro]`],
    ['01:49', `Take a stone.`],
    ['01:50', `The consensus is that a stone is not conscious. Though, not everyone agrees even on this.`],
    ['01:57', `Some panpsychists claim that a lump of rock may have an inner life.`],
    ['02:02', `However, there are no real grounds for any such assumption since stones never show behaviour.`],
    ['02:09', `Their inner life can neither be proven nor disproven.`],
    ['02:14', `A more common starting point is with the living things.`],
    ['02:17', `A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe that sustains itself and makes more of its kind.`],
    ['02:24', `To do so, it needs energy.`],
    ['02:27', `And this is where an awareness of the world comes in handy.`],
    ['02:32', `The original function of consciousness was probably to direct a mobile self that was short of energy`],
    ['02:38', `to a fresh supply of food.`],
    ['02:41', `On the smaller scales of life, you don't need to be aware to find food.`],
    ['02:48', `Trichopax adhaerens - one of the simplest of all animals moves around haphazardly.`],
    ['02:54', `It slows down in the presence of food, and speeds up in its absence.`],
    ['02:59', `This is highly effective, and makes the tiny creature spend more time where there is food`],
    ['03:04', `spend more time where there is food than where there is not.`],
    ['03:07', `But it never moves in a particular direction towards a particular target,`],
    ['03:12', `and there's no need for it to be conscious of its environment.`],
    ['03:16', `The first major step towards consciousness`],
    ['03:19', `was probably taken when mobile selves started to move themselves directionally.`],
    ['03:25', `Moving towards what was good for them, say food, and away from what was less good,`],
    ['03:31', `say someone else who thought that they were food.`],
    ['03:35', `Take Dugesia tigrina - a tiny worm known for its funny face.`],
    ['03:40', `Sometimes the worm is hungry, and sometimes not.`],
    ['03:43', `This means that when it moves,`],
    ['03:45', `the worm self is not simply producing an automatic response to an external stimulus,`],
    ['03:50', `but that its actions depend upon its inner, physiological state,`],
    ['03:54', `whether it's hungry or sated.`],
    ['03:58', `When it's just eaten, the worm is less energetic,`],
    ['04:01', `but when starved for a while, it will move itself in the direction of tasty things.`],
    ['04:08', `It uses chemoreceptors on its head to smell its environment,`],
    ['04:12', `and guide it in the direction where the scent of food is strongest.`],
    ['04:16', `After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads back to a dark sheltered spot to digest it in safety,`],
    ['04:24', `until it's hungry again.`],
    ['04:26', `But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell don't have a concrete objective in view.`],
    ['04:33', `They still lack any sense of where they are heading.`],
    ['04:37', `So, the next step on the ladder of consciousness is to add some perception at a distance,`],
    ['04:43', `like vision.`],
    ['04:46', `Vision adds context and depth to our world.`],
    ['04:49', `With vision comes a sense of the space we and our food exists in.`],
    ['04:54', `It adds a whole new dimension to awareness, and is a huge step towards more familiar consciousness.`],
    ['05:01', `An optical apparatus, like an eye, enables us to visualise our goal and lock onto it.`],
    ['05:08', `But even at this stage, a self is only able to pursue its food as long as it sees it.`],
    ['05:15', `So, the next logical step needs to happen on the inside.`],
    ['05:20', `To visualise food in its absence, for example,`],
    ['05:23', `a self needs to create some sort of inner representation of the world.`],
    ['05:28', `Now, an animal can continue looking for food, even when it escapes its sensory range.`],
    ['05:35', `Because of this inner representation of what is relevant in the world,`],
    ['05:39', `it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it.`],
    ['05:44', `Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with.`],
    ['05:49', `The ability to remember things has emerged.`],
    ['05:53', `Thanks to memory, animals can be distracted from the pursuit for a few seconds,`],
    ['05:57', `but quickly continue their path afterwards.`],
    ['06:00', `A related phenomenon is called 'object permanence'.`],
    ['06:04', `This describes our awareness that things continue to exist even when we can't see them.`],
    ['06:11', `This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals and birds, and perhaps other animals too.`],
    ['06:18', `Human babies tend to develop this ability around the time they turn eight months,`],
    ['06:22', `while baby chickens show this ability within a day or two of being born.`],
    ['06:27', `The capacity to remember a thing in its absence suggests at least a basic sense of time.`],
    ['06:34', `A sense of time is a big step on the ladder of consciousness.`],
    ['06:39', `It may also enable a self to look forward from the present moment and anticipate the future.`],
    ['06:46', `Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put in front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal`],
    ['06:52', `as a prize for holding back for a while.`],
    ['06:55', `This sort of delayed gratification means there is an ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future,`],
    ['07:02', `which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans.`],
    ['07:07', `Western scrub jays are experts in delayed gratification.`],
    ['07:11', `They show an even more elaborate sense of the future when they hide food in a cache`],
    ['07:15', `to retrieve it at a later date.`],
    ['07:18', `The scrub jays will even rehide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them.`],
    ['07:24', `This means that they know that there are other hungry selves out there,`],
    ['07:28', `who are aware and see the world from their own, different perspective.`],
    ['07:33', `Crafty scrub jays can sort of read the mind of their fellow birds.`],
    ['07:38', `This ability to mind-read is crucial for complex levels of consciousness.`],
    ['07:44', `By putting yourself in the position of others, you can outsmart a rich competitor,`],
    ['07:50', `or empathise with a hungry friend.`],
    ['07:53', `Language takes the ability to read minds and represent what is absent to a whole new level.`],
    ['07:58', `Words enable us to construct hypotheses about the world,`],
    ['08:02', `make detailed plans, and to communicate them with others.`],
    ['08:06', `Words enable us to think about ourselves and our place in the universe,`],
    ['08:12', `and even about our own consciousness, which is something we'll be doing more in future videos.`],
    ['08:18', `So, what is the origin of our consciousness?`],
    ['08:21', `It probably began as the directed motion of a hungry self towards a source of food.`],
    ['08:27', `With the survival benefits, this gave it over competitors that moved at random or not at all.`],
    ['08:33', `It probably all started with the urge for more food.`],
    ['08:37', `So, even with the sophisticated consciousness that allows us to dream about space,`],
    ['08:42', `build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels,`],
    ['08:46', `it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking about where we'll get our next meal.`],
    ['08:51', `Collectively, we've put so much thought and ingenuity into getting food,`],
    ['08:56', `that we can now just get our food to come to us with little conscious effort.`],
    ['09:04', `This video is part one of a three-part video series relating to big questions of life and the universe,`],
    ['09:09', `made possible by a grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation.`],
    ['09:14', `You can find our sources and further reading in the video description,`],
    ['09:18', `or get the consciousness book by Rupert Glasgow for free- link down below.`],
    ['09:23', `If you want to help us make more videos, you can do so on patreon.com,`],
    ['09:27', `or get one of our posters from our shop.`]
