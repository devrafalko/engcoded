    ['00:01', `Microbes are everywhere,`],
    ['00:03', `on your phone,`],
    ['00:05', `in your water bottle,`],
    ['00:07', `on your hands before you wash them,`],
    ['00:08', `on your hands after you wash them,`],
    ['00:11', `and literally everywhere else on top of you too.`],
    ['00:14', `Microbes are omnipresent at any moment, and there is nothing we can do about it`],
    ['00:20', `So, millions of years ago we made a pact,`],
    ['00:23', `we give them shelter and food,`],
    ['00:25', `and in turn they work for us.`],
    ['00:28', `But the more we learn about this partnership, the more it looks like a cold war`],
    ['00:44', `Inside our mother's womb, humans start out sterile`],
    ['00:48', `When we are born and traveling through the birth canal,`],
    ['00:50', `billions of our mother's bacteria cover every single part of our bodies.`],
    ['00:55', `This is an essential part of human health.`],
    ['00:57', `Children born via C-section have a higher rate of asthma,`],
    ['01:01', `immune diseases and even leukemia.`],
    ['01:03', `So our bodies do not only accept the invasion of microorganisms, they welcome it.`],
    ['01:10', `Over millions of years, we co-evolved to make the best of our relationship.`],
    ['01:16', `Mother's milk for example,`],
    ['01:17', `contains special sugars that are meant to feed and support`],
    ['01:20', `certain groups of microbes,`],
    ['01:22', `work as a decoy for others,`],
    ['01:23', `and help to modulate the immune system.`],
    ['01:26', `It takes up to two years, until a healthy microbe community has formed.`],
    ['01:31', `Every human has their own unique microbiome, made up of bacteria,`],
    ['01:35', `viruses, fungi and other organisms.`],
    ['01:38', `We have three categories of guests, on and in our bodies.`],
    ['01:42', `One:`],
    ['01:43', `Quiet passengers that do their own thing, and are politely ignored.`],
    ['01:48', `By being there, they take up space and keep more aggressive intruders in check.`],
    ['01:53', `Two:`],
    ['01:54', `Guests that harm us,`],
    ['01:55', `But with whom we've learned to live,`],
    ['01:57', `for example, bacteria that literally create acid that melts our teeth,`],
    ['02:01', `if we don't brush enough.`],
    ['02:02', `They want to take up as much space as they can,`],
    ['02:05', `and we don't want them to.`],
    ['02:06', `But, we can't get rid of them entirely.`],
    ['02:09', `Three:`],
    ['02:10', `Friendly fellows that our bodies want to have around,`],
    ['02:14', `most of them are a community of 380,000 billion bacteria,`],
    ['02:19', `from up to 5,000 different species, that live in our gut.`],
    ['02:23', `These gut microorganisms help us digest food,`],
    ['02:25', `and pull additional calories from things that we can't digest ourselves.`],
    ['02:30', `Unfortunately, our gut is also the perfect point of attack for intruders,`],
    ['02:34', `so it's guarded by an aggressive army,`],
    ['02:36', `our immune system.`],
    ['02:38', `To survive here, our microbiome co-evolved with us`],
    ['02:41', `to be able to communicate with our body.`],
    ['02:44', `The most important part of that is to ask the immune system to not kill them.`],
    ['02:49', `But, they also have a real motivation to keep our gut healthy,`],
    ['02:52', `so some of them produce a messenger substances,`],
    ['02:55', `that help to educate the immune system,`],
    ['02:57', `and others stimulate the gut cells to regenerate faster.`],
    ['03:02', `But, over the last few years.`],
    ['03:03', `Evidence has emerged that the influence of our gut microbiome,`],
    ['03:06', `goes much much further.`],
    ['03:08', `It might even talk directly to our brain.`],
    ['03:12', `We've observed a few curious things,`],
    ['03:15', `90% of our body's serotonin,`],
    ['03:17', `an important messenger substance for nerve cells,`],
    ['03:19', `is produced in the gut.`],
    ['03:21', `Some scientists think the microbiome does this,`],
    ['03:24', `to communicate with the vagus nerve.`],
    ['03:26', `The information highway of our nervous system.`],
    ['03:29', `Other examples are bacteria that stimulate immune cells in the gut,`],
    ['03:33', `so they send a kind of alarm signal to the brain.`],
    ['03:36', `Here, it activates immune cells that help the brain recover from injuries.`],
    ['03:40', `Since the brain decides what we eat,`],
    ['03:43', `the microbiome is interested in a healthy brain.`],
    ['03:46', `A new field of science is opening up here,`],
    ['03:49', `and we're just on the verge of understanding how these`],
    ['03:52', `complex systems inside our bodies interact.`],
    ['03:54', `But we are starting to see how much our microbiome`],
    ['03:58', `actually influences us and our behavior.`],
    ['04:01', `Take depression for example,`],
    ['04:03', `Healthy rats fed microbes from the guts of depressed people,`],
    ['04:06', `began showing anxiety-like behavior,`],
    ['04:09', `and symptoms that look like depression.`],
    ['04:11', `And in early 2017, a study linked the microbiome to intelligence,`],
    ['04:16', `by connecting a certain set up of bacteria in newborns,`],
    ['04:19', `with better motor and language skills.`],
    ['04:22', `But it might also influence our daily lives.`],
    ['04:25', `Tests with fruit flies,`],
    ['04:26', `showed that their microbiome, influenced what kinds of food they craved.`],
    ['04:30', `This could mean your microbes are able to tell your brain,`],
    ['04:34', `which food it should get them.`],
    ['04:36', `Although, this is not a one-way street`],
    ['04:39', `The seed for our microbiome comes from our mother,`],
    ['04:42', `but how it develops and changes, is determined by what we eat.`],
    ['04:46', `the organisms in our gut feed on different things,`],
    ['04:49', `some like fibers and leafy greens,`],
    ['04:51', `others go for sugars and starches,`],
    ['04:53', `and some love greasy fries and butter.`],
    ['04:57', `Our gut is like a garden in which we constantly decide,`],
    ['05:00', `what will grow and blossom.`],
    ['05:03', `If we eat healthily, we breed bacteria that like healthy food.`],
    ['05:07', `If we eat a lot of fast food, then we breed fast food loving bacteria.`],
    ['05:13', `Life is hard, so we can get trapped in a vicious circle.`],
    ['05:17', `You have a stressful time, and eat lots of burgers and fries and pizza.`],
    ['05:22', `This is awesome for fast food bacteria,`],
    ['05:24', `they multiply and multiply, and take up space from vegetable loving bacteria.`],
    ['05:29', `But even worse, they send signals to the brain to continue what it's doing.`],
    ['05:34', `this makes you want more fast food.`],
    ['05:36', `Which breeds more fast food bacteria,`],
    ['05:38', `which makes you crave fast food, and so on.`],
    ['05:43', `This kind of self-reinforcing cycle,`],
    ['05:45', `could play a huge role in obesity.`],
    ['05:47', `But, it's important to stress that you can fight this process,`],
    ['05:50', `and reverse it, by eating healthily and breeding more good bacteria.`],
    ['05:55', `Beyond weight gain, our microbiome has also been linked to other`],
    ['05:58', `serious diseases like autism,`],
    ['06:00', `schizophrenia, and cancer.`],
    ['06:02', `One of the earliest symptoms of Parkinson's, is actually gut problems.`],
    ['06:07', `If your body is overrun with bacteria that harm you,`],
    ['06:10', `there is often only one solution.`],
    ['06:12', `You bring in an army of good guys.`],
    ['06:15', `That's very easy,`],
    ['06:16', `You just transplant some healthy poop.`],
    ['06:20', `You do that by literally transferring poop, from a healthy person,`],
    ['06:23', `into your gut.`],
    ['06:25', `This method is already used, to cure diarrhea`],
    ['06:28', `that's caused when C. difficile bacteria, take over a gut microbiome.`],
    ['06:33', `But we just don't know enough about the complex interplay at work here yet.`],
    ['06:37', `For example, a transplant from an overweight donor cured a woman's diarrhea,`],
    ['06:41', `but contributed to her obesity down the line.`],
    ['06:44', `This caused some ways and another study tried to reverse the effect.`],
    ['06:48', `Poop transplants from slim people to obese ones,`],
    ['06:52', `gave them a more diverse microbiome,`],
    ['06:54', `and made them less sensitive to insulin.`],
    ['06:56', `Both things that also happen when people lose weight`],
    ['07:00', `We need to do a lot more science, to really understand`],
    ['07:03', `how our microbes make us healthy or sick.`],
    ['07:06', `But, whether we like it or not.`],
    ['07:08', `We need our microbiome, and it needs us.`],
    ['07:11', `We'll never have our bodies to ourselves.`],
    ['07:14', `But we have gained a powerful ally,`],
    ['07:17', `if we can just keep the peace.`]
