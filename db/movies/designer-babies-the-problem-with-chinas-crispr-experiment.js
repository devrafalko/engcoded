    ['00:00', `This episode of Real Engineering is brought to you by Skillshare, home to over 25,000`],
    ['00:05', `classes that could teach you a new life skill.`],
    ['00:08', `On Nov 25th 2018 Dr. He Jiankui announced, via youtube, that he had decided to push humankind`],
    ['00:16', `across a controversial threshold.`],
    ['00:19', `This announcement was, of course, that his work had resulted in the birth of twins who`],
    ['00:24', `had both been subject to genetic engineering using CRISPR.`],
    ['00:28', `This was a threshold widely considered to be off limits.`],
    ['00:31', `In 2015 two of the foremost journals in research, Science [1] and Nature [2], both made similar`],
    ['00:37', `statements stating that modification of human germ cells, that is sperm and egg, should`],
    ['00:41', `be avoided.`],
    ['00:42', `The scientific community seemed to have come to an agreement not to experiment with this`],
    ['00:47', `technology until we could agree how and when to apply it to humans, but Dr. He Jiankui`],
    ['00:53', `has unceremoniously dragged us across this line in the sand, whether we like it or not.`],
    ['00:58', `Now, more than ever, there is an urgent need to stop and ask what the outcomes of this`],
    ['01:04', `work are for the individuals who have been subject to it and also how the rest of society`],
    ['01:09', `may be affected.`],
    ['01:11', `...`],
    ['01:12', `To understand all this we’re going to need to understand how CRISPR technology works`],
    ['01:15', `and what the intrinsic shortcomings of this technology are.`],
    ['01:18', `DNA is made of nitrogen and carbon based rings which form 4 distinct chemical codes: Adenine`],
    ['01:24', `(A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T).`],
    ['01:27', `These codes form an easily reproducible double stranded molecule which is read in group of`],
    ['01:33', `threes, called codons, which are contained within structures called genes.`],
    ['01:37', `These genes are simply the parts of the DNA that code for the more structurally complex`],
    ['01:41', `proteins, which in turn, form the biological machines and structures that are required`],
    ['01:46', `for all life on earth.`],
    ['01:48', `Due to DNA’s ability to copy itself, until now the code in the DNA of all humans can`],
    ['01:54', `be traced faithfully to the first cells on earth.`],
    ['01:57', `Dr. He’s work changed all of this by employing the use of the CRISPR-CAS9 technology to purposefully`],
    ['02:04', `change the DNA code in the two twins referred to as Lula and Nana.`],
    ['02:08', `As its name suggests, the CRISPR/CAS9 methodology is dependent on two key parts: CRISPR and`],
    ['02:14', `CAS9.`],
    ['02:15', `CRISPR is a kind of repeating DNA structure that was first discovered accidentally in`],
    ['02:20', `bacterial DNA by the Japanese scientist Yoshizumi Ishino in 1987 [3] . For 17 years following`],
    ['02:27', `this discovery, the exact function of these DNA repeats went undiscovered until it was`],
    ['02:32', `identified as the means by which bacteria identify and protect themselves against invading`],
    ['02:38', `viral DNA [4].`],
    ['02:40', `It turned out that these strange DNA repeats actually came from viruses.`],
    ['02:45', `Bacteria have the ability to cut up invading viral DNA, store it in their own DNA, and`],
    ['02:50', `then subsequently use it as a guide system for the enzymes CAS9, which destroys the viral`],
    ['02:56', `DNA sequence should it invade again in the future.`],
    ['03:00', `In order to do this, CAS9 uses the stored DNA to make something called a guide RNA.`],
    ['03:06', `This guide RNA is usually coded for by a CRISPR repeat, and guides CRISPR to DNA it should`],
    ['03:12', `cut.`],
    ['03:13', `There are two conditions for CRISPR’s binding to its target.`],
    ['03:16', `First Cas9 must bind to the target sequence and a specific 3 code variation in DNA which`],
    ['03:21', `is called a PAM (protospacer adjacent motif).`],
    ['03:23', `Most PAMs can be recognized by Cas9 as they contain the code: *GG.`],
    ['03:28', `These recurring patterns are targeted by a bacteria’s Cas9 system as they identify`],
    ['03:33', `the DNA of invading viruses.`],
    ['03:35', `This gives the bacteria an ability to target and destroy the viral DNA.`],
    ['03:40', `However, in the last 5 years, we have learned to leverage this ability to direct CAS9 with`],
    ['03:46', `guide RNA’s of our own design to alter the genome of other organisms [5].`],
    ['03:51', `The guide RNA binds to a part of CAS9 called the alpha-helical lobe.`],
    ['03:56', `In turn, another domain of CAS9, the nuclease lobe, binds to any flanking part of the DNA`],
    ['04:02', `strands that matches with the guide RNA, causing the double helix structure of the DNA to unwind`],
    ['04:08', `[6].`],
    ['04:09', `This process is facilitated by the proximity between the DNA and the Cas9 complex and electrostatic`],
    ['04:14', `interactions that occur between the RNA and DNA.`],
    ['04:18', `At this point, 2 specific domains of the nuclease lobe cut the DNA.`],
    ['04:23', `Although we’re not yet fully sure how this mechanism occurs, comparative studies suggest`],
    ['04:27', `that the most likely way is that the two seperate parts of Cas9 are able to rip protons from`],
    ['04:32', `water molecules, and in turns weaponize the deprotonated water molecule to break the DNA`],
    ['04:38', `apart [ref].`],
    ['04:39', `This is done at two sites in the DNA, one which cleaves the DNA at the target site (HNH)`],
    ['04:44', `and another which cleaves the DNA at a non-target site (RuvC).`],
    ['04:47', `At this point a number of things can happen depending on which approach is needed:`],
    ['04:51', `- Cas9 can be modified to include a deaminase enzyme which can target specific bases for`],
    ['04:57', `mutation, leading to brand new mutations.`],
    ['05:00', `- a process known as homology directed repair can be used to insert new DNA at the cutting`],
    ['05:06', `site.`],
    ['05:07', `-Or the targeted piece of DNA can be simply cut out and removed if it is deemed to be`],
    ['05:11', `undesirable.`],
    ['05:12', `Dr. He Jankui opted for the latter option and simply cut a section out of a gene called`],
    ['05:18', `CCR5.`],
    ['05:20', `The section that was cut corresponded to a mutation known as delta32, that confers it’s`],
    ['05:26', `owners with protection to certain strands of HIV.`],
    ['05:28', `Dr. He’s data seems to suggest he may have artificially induced a mutation, similar to,`],
    ['05:35', `but not identical to the delta 32 mutation in these twins [7].`],
    ['05:39', `In order to do this, Dr. He had to first optimize the gene editing protocol in mice, monkey`],
    ['05:45', `and human cells.`],
    ['05:46', `The reason for this is to make sure the protocol has high specificity - simply put, that the`],
    ['05:51', `gene editing technique was editing the target DNA and not some other sequence.`],
    ['05:56', `This claim is of course key to the validity of the experiment.`],
    ['06:00', `Unedited embryos can be thrown away after all - but for obvious reasons, making unspecific`],
    ['06:06', `alterations to a human’s genetic code would be a major red flag...and Dr. He’s work`],
    ['06:11', `raises major red flags for this exact reason.`],
    ['06:15', `Their check for specificity of gene editing used parental genetics as a reference point,`],
    ['06:20', `an inadequate approach due to the fact that a parent’s genetic material is subject to`],
    ['06:25', `a certain degree of randomization every time a sperm or egg is produced.`],
    ['06:29', `It’s further complicated by the fact that no two sperm or eggs will be the same and`],
    ['06:34', `that their methodology did not account for the possibility that larger sections of the`],
    ['06:38', `genetic code could be deleted by their implementation of the Crispr/Cas9 system.`],
    ['06:44', `Further to this, from the data released so far we can tell that the mutation induced`],
    ['06:48', `in the twins does not exactly mirror the delta32 population that He is attempting to induce`],
    ['06:54', `in the twins [8].`],
    ['06:55', `Although the protein produced should in theory largely mirror the naturally occuring mutation,`],
    ['07:01', `we cannot tell that for sure because it has not been tested.`],
    ['07:05', `Standard practice at this point is to test these mutations in an animal model in order`],
    ['07:09', `to assess unexpected effects of the experiment.`],
    ['07:13', `This is perhaps the most troublesome part of this experiment.`],
    ['07:16', `Lulu and Nana are test subjects for a genetic mutation that we have not even taken the time`],
    ['07:22', `and care to test in animals.`],
    ['07:24', `Nonetheless, the mutation was induced in a total of 31 human embryos.`],
    ['07:29', `These embryos were grown for a period of 5-8 days and the 19 that were deemed “normal”`],
    ['07:34', `were taken forward.`],
    ['07:36', `Out of these 19 embryos 2 were implanted in the mother to give rise to the twins.`],
    ['07:41', `These concerns over Lulu’s and Nana’s well being are only one of a myriad of issues:`],
    ['07:47', `Perhaps most critically there was no medical need for this treatment in the first place.`],
    ['07:51', `It has been claimed that the biological father of the twins is HIV positive.`],
    ['07:57', `Given that the couple used IVF, and that there is no evidence that HIV would be passed on`],
    ['08:02', `from father to child using this method of conception.`],
    ['08:05', `The procedure was medically unnecessary.`],
    ['08:08', `Furthermore, He claims to have induced this mutation completely into at least one of the`],
    ['08:13', `twins.`],
    ['08:14', `To do this, He and his group would have had to check the DNA in every cell in the growing`],
    ['08:19', `blastocyst, a group of cells that exist from days 5-9 post fertilization that eventually`],
    ['08:24', `becomes the embryo.`],
    ['08:26', `Given that they would have to destroy the blastocyst to test all the cells, a clear`],
    ['08:30', `logistical problem exists in trying to qualify that the mutation exists in all the cells.`],
    ['08:36', `Accordingly, He and his group only checked a number of cells from the blastocyst.`],
    ['08:41', `This means both twins might have a condition called mosaicism, where the deletion only`],
    ['08:46', `occurs in a subset of their cells.`],
    ['08:48', `This means that different cells in their body, have different DNA.`],
    ['08:51', `In this context, the effects of this condition are completely unstudied.`],
    ['08:56', `Finally, the gene that He took aim at has also been reported to have a role in learning.`],
    ['09:01', `A link between the activity of the CCR5 gene product and the dampening down of the brain’s`],
    ['09:07', `ability to form new neural connections has been previously described in mice models.`],
    ['09:12', `Theoretically, there is a possibility that the induced deletion could have a positive`],
    ['09:16', `effect on the twin’s ability to learn.`],
    ['09:19', `Right now there are far too many unknowns to make an accurate prediction on what if`],
    ['09:24', `any effect this experiment will have on the two twins and there’s an even bigger question`],
    ['09:29', `about what effect the announcement will have on the progress of the field.`],
    ['09:34', `Complicating this mess is the fact that this study did not go in front of an adequate ethics`],
    ['09:38', `approval board and default Chinese law prohibits any kind of follow up with the twins.`],
    ['09:44', `Because of this, we will likely never know what will become of Lulu and Nana.`],
    ['09:48', `Dr. He has stated that he plans to publish the work in a peer reviewed journal, but given`],
    ['09:53', `that he has gone M.I.A for almost 2 months now [9], the scientific community may never`],
    ['09:58', `have an opportunity to properly review and digest the impact of this work.`],
    ['10:03', `So where do we go from here?`],
    ['10:05', `There is no doubt that genetic engineering is a valuable tool that can potentially safely`],
    ['10:10', `increase human wellbeing and productivity.`],
    ['10:13', `It’s not unlikely that plunging into these uncharted waters unaccounted and without approval`],
    ['10:19', `may have a chilling effect on the proper utilization and development of this technology though.`],
    ['10:24', `Perhaps, until a consensus on the way forward is established this is a good thing.`],
    ['10:29', `Thankfully, the World Health Organization has stepped up to take a moderating role in`],
    ['10:33', `the process and are establishing a working group to establish clear guidelines.`],
    ['10:38', `We need these guidelines because we’ve stepped into a new era of medicine.`],
    ['10:43', `One where the genetic modification of humans is not only a possibility but an increasingly`],
    ['10:47', `real option.`],

    ['10:53', `From the printing press to the internet, these inventions exist to expand our knowledge and`],
    ['10:57', `inform us.`],
    ['10:58', `Maybe one day we’ll be able to alter our genes to make ourselves smarter, but in the`],
    ['11:02', `meantime we’re already surrounded by tools for this, like watching educational videos`],
