    ['00:00', `If you ever feel like sometimes there's this underlying`],
    ['00:03', `uneasiness that we can feel in life sometimes`],
    ['00:05', `like we're never really fully content with how things are something could always be better`],
    ['00:12', `I was hoping that today we could delve into what might be the root cause of some of those feelings in ways that we can maybe`],
    ['00:18', `overcome it a way to create space to feel content but not like a shallow short-lived happiness`],
    ['00:25', `I mean finding balance calmness and peace in our everyday lives`],
    ['00:33', `So just to give you a little bit of background here the information I'm sharing in today's video is based on a book`],
    ['00:38', `Called "A New Earth" by Eckhart Tolle. It's one of the few resources`],
    ['00:41', `I've come across in my life that shifted the way my mind works and how I process my emotions`],
    ['00:47', `In the book Tolle introduces the concept of having an ego, which is usually an attribute`],
    ['00:53', `we associate with somebody who feels like they're a lot better than everyone else`],
    ['00:57', `But for the sake of the ego, we're gonna be talking about in today's video. That's not what I want you to think`],
    ['01:03', `Instead. I want you to see the ego as this identity that we've created about ourselves`],
    ['01:09', `For example, you might say I'm a really good illustrator. I'm a hard worker`],
    ['01:13', `I'm a multitasker and I'm also an anxious person. I keep making stupid life choices`],
    ['01:19', `I don't think anyone likes me and this and that thing about my body are ugly in all of these thoughts whether they were`],
    ['01:26', `Positive or negative the ego is hidden in the words`],
    ['01:30', `I, me, my or mine. I am a hard worker`],
    ['01:34', `My body is ugly and these beliefs about our personalities our talents our abilities`],
    ['01:40', `These are our ego. It's a mental construction that we've created of ourself`],
    ['01:46', `So it's our self-image and it's artificial`],
    ['01:49', `The more we identify with these things as being real the more the ego creates`],
    ['01:55', `emotional drama in our lives`],
    ['01:57', `* Characteristics of the EGO *`],
    ['02:00', `There's a few aspects of the ego that are really important to point out for one the ego loves to identify with things that`],
    ['02:07', `Enhances its sense of self-worth. That's my car my partner my clothes. This is my life, my story`],
    ['02:14', `The ego also loves to compare comparing our positive attributes to someone else's negative attributes or the other way around`],
    ['02:22', `like for example saying something like`],
    ['02:24', `Everyone around me seems to have their life together, and I don't know what I'm doing`],
    ['02:28', `Or why am I always the hard worker and he's always so lazy`],
    ['02:32', `The ego loves to attach itself to labels because labels enforce that sense of self. Those people are successful`],
    ['02:39', `I'm a failure or I'm a hard worker that person is lazy.`],
    ['02:41', `Me versus them and when we`],
    ['02:46', `Validate labels we feed the ego`],
    ['02:49', `Complaining is another aspect of the ego and also helps to strengthen it whether we're just complaining silently to ourselves`],
    ['02:56', `Mentally or when we vocalize it and complain out loud`],
    ['02:59', `We complain about the situation that we're in or how someone acted or how we look`],
    ['03:03', `The ego just feeds off of the drama and let's say for example that we don't like how we look`],
    ['03:09', `subconsciously without even being aware of it the ego tells us that maybe if we buy more things`],
    ['03:15', `Beautiful things then we too will be beautiful. Maybe these new material possessions will boost our self-worth`],
    ['03:22', `But the thing with the ego is is it's never fully satisfied that feeling of pleasure that comes after some retail therapy`],
    ['03:29', `It's always short-lived because the ego is already looking for something else`],
    ['03:33', `wanting something more`],
    ['03:38', `So what do we do about all of this Tolle says that the key to`],
    ['03:42', `Transcending the ego is to simply become aware of it`],
    ['03:45', `the problem is the ego is usually hidden in the stream of`],
    ['03:49', `unconscious thoughts that runs through our heads so rapidly every single day but as soon as we become aware of the thoughts the`],
    ['03:56', `Attachments the labels the comparing the complaining we are no longer the thoughts. We're now the`],
    ['04:02', `Awareness the person observing the thoughts the thoughts are just thoughts`],
    ['04:07', `The feelings are just feelings, but they're not us. We're not identified with it`],
    ['04:11', `And so awareness of the ego is the key to transcending it`],
    ['04:18', `If we want to easily spot the ego we just need to look for the trail of emotional drama`],
    ['04:23', `It leaves behind in our lives and it manifests itself in feelings of dissatisfaction`],
    ['04:30', `anxiety anger`],
    ['04:32', `Insecurity these feelings are usually strongly associated with our sense of self image. So anytime you notice yourself saying the words`],
    ['04:40', `I me my or mine`],
    ['04:43', `Chances are your ego is at play here`],
    ['04:45', `so for example`],
    ['04:46', `We never really cared about the car until it became my car`],
    ['04:50', `We didn't feel jealous about that person until it became my partner`],
    ['04:54', `I wouldn't have cared about the plate at the store`],
    ['04:56', `But as soon as my plate breaks`],
    ['04:58', `I'm upset another really easy way to spot the ego is anytime we feel like we don't have enough of something because the ego always`],
    ['05:05', `Wants more more success more money more attention more pleasure`],
    ['05:10', `And anytime it doesn't feel like it has enough of something`],
    ['05:14', `it can make us feel like we're the ones that`],
    ['05:17', `Aren't enough. And the thing with the ego is we can never really fully ever get rid of it completely`],
    ['05:22', `It's always gonna be there but how strong of a role it plays in our lives depends on how much we let it run free`],
    ['05:29', `unconsciously and the key word there is`],
    ['05:32', `unconsciously`],
    ['05:35', `So now that we know how to spot the ego`],
    ['05:37', `Let's go over some ways that we can reduce its presence in our lives kind of actionable items that we can put into practice today`],
    ['05:45', `for one being more open and honest, you know how sometimes a friend or family member asks how you're doing and you're like, oh`],
    ['05:51', `Yeah, I'm really good even though you know, that's not true. That's the ego`],
    ['05:56', `It's trying to maintain a certain self-image maybe that of being happy or perfect`],
    ['06:01', `So instead try being open and honest and tell the person how you feel`],
    ['06:05', `This isn't just say go ahead and complain that would be the ego again, but just state the facts you'll notice that so much`],
    ['06:13', `Stress is lifted off of your shoulders when you do`],
    ['06:15', `Another thing that we can do is to find the value in the work that we do seeing how our work provides`],
    ['06:23', `Value instead of viewing it as something that we do for recognition or for fame or monetary gain`],
    ['06:28', `the ego hides behind the eye and the knee`],
    ['06:31', `So if we act in a selfless way for other people, this is another way we can transcend the ego`],
    ['06:37', `doing things not because we expect something in return but doing it because we feel it benefits the greater good in some way and`],
    ['06:45', `finally the last place that the ego just really doesn't exist in our lives is when we're in the present moment because the ego`],
    ['06:52', `Can't be busy thinking about the past or worrying about the future when it's in the now or when we are in the now`],
    ['07:00', `For everyone being in the present moment can come about in different ways`],
    ['07:03', `Like maybe if you're photographing`],
    ['07:05', `Or painting and you're really engrossed in it or for some people. They're more in the moment when they're meditating or exercising or doing yoga`],
    ['07:12', `Spending time in nature writing gratitude lists playing with their pets whatever it is`],
    ['07:18', `It's these moments the now moments when the ego isn't present in our lives and these these`],
    ['07:24', `Concepts of the ego that I've shared with you today`],
    ['07:26', `This is just the basics of what the ego is and the role that it can play in our lives`],
    ['07:32', `But what I've shared is nothing compared to the depths and insights that Eckhart Tolle shares in his books`],
    ['07:37', `It's one of those books`],
    ['07:38', `I know I'm gonna return to over and over it explores the topic and so much more depth. The scenarios are just incredible`],
    ['07:46', `I wholeheartedly recommend the book`],
    ['07:48', `I want to thank audible for partnering with us on this video`],
    ['07:51', `If you'd like you can get this book or any other book of your choosing`],
    ['07:54', `For free plus a 30-day free membership by visiting audible.com/pickuplimes, or see the link in the description box below`],
    ['08:02', `I really hope that you found today's topic`],
    ['08:05', `Valuable that it's helped to relieve any uneasiness. You might be feeling in your life to help you understand it a little bit better`],
    ['08:12', `I know that it did that for me for sure. Just`],
    ['08:16', `Personifying the ego separating it from ourselves and observing it`],
    ['08:19', `What it does how it behaves it really helps to not put so much of the pressure on ourselves at least`],
    ['08:25', `That's how I felt about it. Thanks a lot for watching today's video. Hope you enjoyed pickup lines signing off`],
