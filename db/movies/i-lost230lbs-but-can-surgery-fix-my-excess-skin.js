    ['00:28', `I am very, very nervous.`],
    ['00:30', `I'm about to go in. Chris: Love you baby,`],
    ['00:32', `see you in a little bit.`],
    ['00:42', `Noelle: Throughout my childhood, I was a gymnast. So I was very, very active.`],
    ['00:48', `My coaches were very strict with our eating habits.`],
    ['00:51', `Anytime I would indulge,`],
    ['00:53', `they could see the next day in my performance and they would punish us.`],
    ['01:00', `When I quit gymnastics, I was able to enjoy all the foods that`],
    ['01:04', `I wasn't able to enjoy during my training.`],
    ['01:07', `So I overindulged and continued to overindulge.`],
    ['01:11', `That then turned into 15, almost 20 years of me abusing food.`],
    ['01:18', `Little different. Chris: Or a lot different.`],
    ['01:22', `Noelle: When I met Christian in 2004,`],
    ['01:24', `I was around 325 pounds at that time.`],
    ['01:30', `Someone had some moves. Huh.`],
    ['01:33', `Chris: Who said had?`],
    ['01:35', `Noelle: He had a little bit of moves back then.`],
    ['01:38', `Chris: Not the same person. Noelle: No.`],
    ['01:40', `I knew I wanted to become a mother. We'd struggled quite a bit.`],
    ['01:44', `We tried for years and still could not become pregnant.`],
    ['01:48', `That caused just for my weight to spiral even more.`],
    ['01:53', `The weight just piled on I ended up over 350 pounds.`],
    ['01:58', `We had two failed adoptions. I hit almost 400 pounds at that point.`],
    ['02:05', `And then we decided to go an alternate route and that was`],
    ['02:08', `through DCS and foster care to adopt our children.`],
    ['02:12', `We were successful and adopted four amazing children`],
    ['02:17', `and then became pregnant two years after the adoption.`],

    ['02:27', `I remember waking up every morning thinking,`],
    ['02:29', `Oh my gosh, I woke up. I'm alive.`],
    ['02:33', `When's that day I'm not going to wake up due to how heavy I was.`],
    ['02:38', `My weight held me back from everything.`],
    ['02:40', `I struggled walking. I struggled putting my shoes on.`],
    ['02:45', `I struggled taking my kids anywhere.`],
    ['02:48', `Six months waking up every day thinking you're lucky to be alive.`],
    ['02:53', `And I thought I'm so lost though.`],
    ['02:56', `I have to lose over 200 pounds here.`],
    ['02:58', `How can I possibly do this?`],
    ['03:00', `I decided to face the scale.`],
    ['03:03', `Got home stepped on the scale, scale read error.`],
    ['03:07', `Okay, needs new batteries right surely`],
    ['03:10', `put in new batteries, stepped on it again and it read error again.`],
    ['03:14', `I look up the scale max weight limit was 408 pounds`],
    ['03:20', `no way.`],
    ['03:21', `There's no way I had 400 pounds.`],
    ['03:24', `Back in my head I knew because of how miserable, I'd never been this miserable before.`],
    ['03:29', `And sure enough, we ordered another scale and I weighed in at 414 pounds.`],
    ['03:35', `And I was devastated. My heart sank.`],
    ['03:38', `And I knew if I didn't make a change in that moment,`],
    ['03:41', `there was going to be no more Noelle; I wasn't going to be here anymore.`],
    ['03:46', `The beginning of my journey I really focused on my nutrition`],
    ['03:49', `for the first 11 months.`],
    ['03:53', `Boy: We used to not eat as well back then.`],
    ['03:56', `Noelle: Three or four times a week we’re eat now.`],
    ['03:58', `Boy: Yeah, but now we're eating better.`],

    ['04:05', `Noelle: And once I got to a 200 pound weight loss,`],
    ['04:10', `I realised it was time to start working out I had all of this energy,`],
    ['04:14', `becoming that active after years of, you know,`],
    ['04:19', `sitting on the couch was, oh my gosh,`],
    ['04:23', `the high that I got from being at the gym was incredible.`],
    ['04:27', `Caleb: She's just very determined. You know, she's always in here`],
    ['04:30', `always working, always trying to get a little bit better.`],
    ['04:32', `Every time I see her she little bit more determined a little bit more.`],
    ['04:37', `She has more of a purpose. She's on a mission.`],
    ['04:39', `Noelle: I went from being immobile to very mobile`],
    ['04:41', `and now the sky is the limit.`],
    ['04:43', `I've lost 234 pounds in 14 months.`],
    ['04:59', `I am very proud of myself I'm very body positive however.`],
    ['05:02', `Of course I have natural insecurities with the skin.`],
    ['05:07', `In three weeks I'll be having skin removal surgery,`],
    ['05:10', `just to not have to tuck it in all the time.`],
    ['05:12', `You know when I'm working out, the skin`],
    ['05:14', `slides right out during my workouts out of my pants.`],
    ['05:17', `I'll be having an extended arm lift.`],
    ['05:19', `So he’ll be cutting me off from here all the way down into my armpit,`],
    ['05:23', `and then an extended Tummy Tuck which is going to go from hip to hip,`],
    ['05:26', `where he’ll pull down all of my loose skin here.`],
    ['05:29', `And then I'm having a breast reduction and a breast lift`],
    ['05:32', `to kind of put them back where they belong.`],
    ['05:34', `And that is going to be life changing for me.`],
    ['05:37', `I am very, very nervous about this surgery.`],
    ['05:41', `I'm here with Dr. Galvez he just marked me up and I'm all ready for tomorrow.`],
    ['05:46', `We are officially one day out from my surgery.`],
    ['05:49', `I am so nervous.`],
    ['05:51', `I'm in the pre OR I'm about to go into the operating room`],
    ['05:55', `and surgery will be eight to nine hours.`],
    ['05:57', `Chris: Love you baby. Noelle: Love you too.`],
    ['05:59', `Chris: See you in a little bit.`],
    ['06:11', `Girl: Swim Leila swim.`],
    ['06:18', `Chris: You know, my wife's transformation her, outward appearance is amazing.`],
    ['06:23', `You can see the results that she's worked for.`],
    ['06:25', `I think the biggest thing for me is her mental transformation.`],
    ['06:28', `You know it's like a new light has been turned on it's even brighter`],
    ['06:32', `and she shines.`],
    ['06:50', `Noelle: I'm able to see the true results now that the skin has been removed.`],
    ['06:55', `What it feels like now to be able to do all the things I couldn't do before`],
    ['06:59', `is an indescribable feeling.`],
    ['07:01', `It's a feeling that I'll be forever grateful for`],
    ['07:04', `and it continues to inspire me and motivate me to stay on the right track.`],
    ['07:09', `I'm able to live my life with my children, enjoy watching them grow up`],
    ['07:14', `and be in on the action. That's the best part of this journey.`],
    ['07:17', `I've learned so much about myself, and my relationship with food,`],
    ['07:22', `that I am worthy, that I am enough.`],
    ['07:25', `Boy, it feels so good to feel free from these chains`],
    ['07:30', `that held me back from being happy.`],
    ['07:37', `I want others to take from this story that they are worthy,`],
    ['07:41', `that they are enough and that no matter where you`],
    ['07:44', `are in your journey, you have to love who you are.`]
