    ['00:06', `and you have to not give up until you find it.`],
    ['00:15', `Hey guys!`],
    ['00:16', `So I just wanted to do a casual vlog from my car.`],
    ['00:19', `I just did a photoshoot today.`],
    ['00:21', `It was super fun and on the way home – it's sunset time, so I'm like,`],
    ['00:24', `"You know what? Why not just vlog in the car?"`],
    ['00:27', `So I want to talk about how I figured out what to do with my life.`],
    ['00:30', `And since it is graduation season and I recently launched the Create Your Dream Life course,`],
    ['00:35', `I feel like it's the perfect time to talk about this.`],
    ['00:38', `By the way, if you haven't heard about my course, I'll link it down below so that you can check it out.`],
    ['00:42', `I'm super excited about it.`],
    ['00:43', `But personally, when I was 21, straight out of college, I was literally depressed`],
    ['00:50', `because I didn't know what to do with my life, and I've always been a good student.`],
    ['00:55', `I knew how to get good grades and do well in school because there was a syllabus.`],
    ['01:00', `There was homework and guidelines, and I felt like I had the rules set out.`],
    ['01:04', `I knew how to work within the rules.`],
    ['01:07', `But when life happened, I literally was like, "Oh my god, there's no rules to life.`],
    ['01:12', `It's too open-ended that I don't know what to do with my life."`],
    ['01:15', `And I was asking my teachers, asking friends and anyone in a mentor position to me,`],
    ['01:22', `"Tell me how to get there. How can I become successful?"`],
    ['01:26', `I would have a lot of talks and ask people, "How do I figure out my life?"`],
    ['01:30', `And people just laughed at me like, "There's no rules.`],
    ['01:33', `There's no step-by-step process to becoming successful or doing what you want to do.`],
    ['01:39', `So you just gotta go figure it out."`],
    ['01:42', `And so I was really frustrated during that time,`],
    ['01:44', `because there was no step-by-step thing for me to follow.`],
    ['01:47', `And the way I figured it out was: I listened to my heart.`],
    ['01:52', `I listened to the things that I truly loved to do, the things that brought me joy,`],
    ['01:58', `because my whole dream life is: I want to make a living, an abundant living,`],
    ['02:02', `but also doing something that I love and doing something that matters.`],
    ['02:07', `I really had this deep desire to do something positive and make a positive impact on the world.`],
    ['02:12', `So that was a really important criteria to me.`],
    ['02:15', `And when I was working at advertising agencies on all these office jobs,`],
    ['02:20', `I just didn't feel like it was meaningful work.`],
    ['02:22', `I felt like I was a little ant in this big corporation that –`],
    ['02:26', `I was just helping other people make money, and it wasn't meaningful to me.`],
    ['02:30', `Thus, if you don't know my story, I dove headfirst into a creative path where I pursued music.`],
    ['02:37', `I thought I wanted to be an artist in music, and I made YouTube videos, music videos.`],
    ['02:43', `I came out with an album, and at the same time, I was like, "Ugh, I love performing," so I tried acting.`],
    ['02:49', `I did a bunch of auditions, put myself out there in LA.`],
    ['02:53', `And I got some hosting, freelance gigs.`],
    ['02:56', `And then on the side, I did marketing and made videos for a food festival in LA.`],
    ['03:02', `So I did a lot of fun jobs, and honestly, the way I figured it out was a lot of trial and error.`],
    ['03:09', `I tried music, and it was fun.`],
    ['03:11', `I performed a lot, but over time, I hated the part of traveling and performing place to place.`],
    ['03:20', `I really disliked packing all my music equipment and taking it to the venue`],
    ['03:26', `and then setting everything up with my laptop, keyboard, everything.`],
    ['03:31', `It was just a pain.`],
    ['03:33', `And I realized that, as much as I love music, I don't like the idea of touring`],
    ['03:39', `and moving from place to place physically, and lugging all this musical gear.`],
    ['03:46', `And a part of me knew that I didn't want to grow old doing that.`],
    ['03:50', `So even though I loved music, I knew that that career was not for me`],
    ['03:53', `because I didn't love every aspect of that career.`],
    ['03:57', `It wasn't really aligned with my dream life.`],
    ['04:02', `It's only when you actually put yourself into these situations,`],
    ['04:07', `take action in the direction that you think is right for you, that the truth will reveal itself to you.`],
    ['04:13', `The truth will reveal itself in a way that you'll be like, "Oh, I don't really like this aspect.`],
    ['04:19', `Hm, this doesn't really align to my dream life, so maybe this is not the right path for me."`],
    ['04:24', `And so you try it and then you take another turn, and then you try something else.`],
    ['04:28', `And that was really my way of doing it.`],
    ['04:31', `And along the way, I read a ton of books on self help and how to be successful,`],
    ['04:36', `how to have that positive mindset, how to overcome your fears, how to beat resistance,`],
    ['04:43', `all of those books.`],
    ['04:44', `I read so many books on creativity and how to be an artist because a lot of it is your mindset.`],
    ['04:51', `I've listed my favorite books, I've shared my favorite books that have helped me in my journey, but it's a lot.`],
    ['04:58', `I would say, figuring out what I wanted to do is half trial-and-error`],
    ['05:02', `of actually taking action in the directions that I thought I wanted to do,`],
    ['05:07', `and then getting feedback from those paths whether it's things that I realized I did like.`],
    ['05:13', `And then the other half is actually building the skills, building the habits,`],
    ['05:17', `the knowledge to actually be a successful person in that field,`],
    ['05:22', `because I think knowing how to do it is one way.`],
    ['05:25', `And then having the stamina, the habits, the mindset to do it is another thing,`],
    ['05:30', `because most people, they know how to do it,`],
    ['05:33', `but they don't have the commitment or the level of strength, a very –`],
    ['05:39', `what's that called – mental toughness and grit to make it,`],
    ['05:44', `because once you know what you want to do,`],
    ['05:47', `the second part is "Okay, how am I actually going to be successful at this?"`],
    ['05:51', `So that took me a few years to figure out.`],
    ['05:55', `But I will tell you that, after a few years of trying all these random creative projects,`],
    ['06:00', `a part of me thought that I gave up on YouTube`],
    ['06:02', `because I had been doing a music YouTube channel for,`],
    ['06:06', `I don't know, five or so years and it wasn't really moving.`],
    ['06:09', `It wasn't growing. It was stagnant.`],
    ['06:12', `But I would spend so much time watching YouTubers`],
    ['06:14', `like Jenn Im, Michelle Phan, and I envied their lifestyle.`],
    ['06:19', `And a part of me was like, "Why do I envy their lifestyle so much?`],
    ['06:23', `I thought I wanted to be a musician.`],
    ['06:25', `I thought I wanted to be an actress," or something else.`],
    ['06:28', `And I had to just be honest with myself:`],
    ['06:31', `"Girl, even though you're failing at your YouTube channel in music right now,`],
    ['06:36', `you still want to be a YouTuber and you still want to create content on YouTube."`],
    ['06:40', `Just everything about the content creator lifestyle, I realized, aligned with what I wanted,`],
    ['06:45', `because I could be creative, I could make videos that impact people and inspire people in a positive way,`],
    ['06:52', `and it could be time-independent, location-independent.`],
    ['06:56', `I had a lot of freedom because I want to be able to travel and work from anywhere in the world.`],
    ['07:03', `And I want to be able to wake up and sleep whenever I want.`],
    ['07:07', `And that's another reason why I couldn't really go into any traditional entertainment position,`],
    ['07:13', `because even if you're an actress, waking up?`],
    ['07:15', `Those hours are tough.`],
    ['07:17', `I don't want to wake up and work 12-hour days, 6 AM to 6 PM, 6 PM to 6 AM.`],
    ['07:23', `You guys don't understand.`],
    ['07:25', `Hours for people in entertainment is intense.`],
    ['07:28', `So I knew I wanted to form my own hours.`],
    ['07:31', `So it was understanding my guidelines for what my dream life looks like,`],
    ['07:36', `and then finding a path that filled as much of those guidelines as possible.`],
    ['07:42', `And for me, it ended up being: my own boss, creating content.`],
    ['07:47', `Honestly, when I started Lavendaire, nobody took me seriously.`],
    ['07:51', `I mean, I was like 23.`],
    ['07:53', `How can you be 23, still struggling in life, struggling to make money,`],
    ['07:58', `struggling to figure out what you're supposed to do,`],
    ['08:00', `and trying to teach people how to live their life?`],
    ['08:02', `It was a weird paradox, but I believed in my vision`],
    ['08:06', `and I believed in myself, and I knew that I was going to succeed.`],
    ['08:10', `I had to have that strong belief because in my mind,`],
    ['08:13', `I was making these videos as if I was documenting my journey to success.`],
    ['08:20', `Honestly, the people around me at the time just thought I was ridiculous`],
    ['08:24', `and they didn't really understand what self help and personal growth was until I just did it.`],
    ['08:29', `And I'll tell you: Even a year into doing my channel, I didn't grow that much.`],
    ['08:35', `I grew, I don't know, 1,000 subscribers in one year?`],
    ['08:38', `But the impact I felt from people who did comment on my videos`],
    ['08:43', `and people who did email me during that first year,`],
    ['08:45', `I knew for sure that I was on the right path.`],
    ['08:49', `It was an intuitive feeling that "Oh my god, this is actually helping people.`],
    ['08:54', `This is actually benefiting people in a real way.`],
    ['08:57', `And it doesn't matter if I'm not making any money off of this.`],
    ['09:00', `I feel like I matter, and I feel like I'm doing something that I really enjoy."`],
    ['09:07', `I think once you land on the right path, you will know.`],
    ['09:11', `Intuitively, you will feel it.`],
    ['09:15', `Sometimes you don't know that it's right for you until you get there`],
    ['09:19', `because sometimes you think you know and then you try it and it turns out it's not the right path.`],
    ['09:24', `That's how music was for me.`],
    ['09:25', `I really was so "I'm going to be an artist. I want to be on SoundCloud.`],
    ['09:31', `I want to blow up my SoundCloud and perform and do all this stuff," and I really, really wanted it.`],
    ['09:37', `And I really, really thought I could be an amazing artist.`],
    ['09:39', `I mean, I still have that – I do believe in my musical talent, but there were so many buts along the way.`],
    ['09:49', `It didn't feel 100% aligned to what I was supposed to do.`],
    ['09:53', `But music still has a special place in my heart.`],
    ['09:55', `It's still a big hobby of mine and I still love it.`],
    ['09:58', `But in terms of life path, Lavendaire just felt so much more right to me.`],
    ['10:05', `I hope this made sense.`],
    ['10:07', `This is kind of a messy car vlog, but I hope that you guys got the gist of it,`],
    ['10:11', `that a lot of it is trial and error,`],
    ['10:14', `and then the other half is investing in yourself: reading, learning, taking courses,`],
    ['10:19', `so that you can build the strength and the stamina and the mindset and the habits.`],
    ['10:27', `Just keep doing it, keep going no matter what.`],
    ['10:30', `Don't settle for anything less, because if you don't feel like this is your right path,`],
    ['10:33', `but it's like 70% there –`],
    ['10:36', `maybe you're like, "Eh, I'm making pretty good money with what I'm doing.`],
    ['10:39', `I don't absolutely love it, but it's okay" – I don't want you guys to settle there.`],
    ['10:44', `I want you to know that there will always be something`],
    ['10:47', `that feels 100% aligned to what you're meant to do`],
    ['10:51', `and you have to not give up until you find it.`],
    ['10:56', `And that sounds scary.`],
    ['10:58', `That advice is really scary because you're taking a risk.`],
    ['11:01', `A lot of people will be like, "Well, what if I fail? What if I quit my great job now`],
    ['11:06', `and I go and I pursue this very new and different path, and what if I fail?`],
    ['11:12', `What if I lose everything?"`],
    ['11:14', `Well, you know what, girl?`],
    ['11:15', `If you fail, that means you tried.`],
    ['11:18', `And failing will teach you something.`],
    ['11:21', `After walking that new path and failing at it,`],
    ['11:24', `you're going to be so much more ahead in that direction,`],
    ['11:28', `and you're going to learn so much from that experience.`],
    ['11:31', `And that failure will lead you to where you're meant to go, I am for sure.`],
    ['11:37', `Regardless of whether it works out or doesn't work out, it's the right choice for you,`],
    ['11:41', `because for me, I had to go try out music.`],
    ['11:45', `It had to fail a few times, and that led me to what I'm doing now.`],
    ['11:50', `Same thing with other stuff: the acting, the hosting, marketing.`],
    ['11:53', `I was working for that food festival job for two or three years, basically three years.`],
    ['12:01', `And I was in a good position to grow with the company.`],
    ['12:03', `My boss even offered me a huge promotion during the year that I started Lavendaire,`],
    ['12:08', `and I was considering, "Okay, do I want to have this promotion, work full time,`],
    ['12:13', `booking performers for the stage and all of this stuff?"`],
    ['12:17', `And deep down in my heart, I knew that I didn't want to stay with that company.`],
    ['12:21', `Even though it was a fun job, I knew that I had better ways to spend my time.`],
    ['12:26', `So I quit that job, knowing that I would put all of my heart into Lavendaire,`],
    ['12:31', `knowing that I was not going to make any money from Lavendaire.`],
    ['12:34', `I did not make money –`],
    ['12:35', `after I quit my job, I pursued Lavendaire for a full year or two before any money trickled in.`],
    ['12:41', `Literally, I had no income for the whole year of 2015.`],
    ['12:45', `And 2016, things started coming in slowly.`],
    ['12:48', `And then 2017 was the year that I launched the Artist of Life Workbook,`],
    ['12:53', `and that was my first confident income year.`],
    ['12:56', `2017 was my confident income year.`],
    ['12:59', `2018 was an amazing year.`],
    ['13:01', `Flying colors, guys.`],
    ['13:03', `Thank you so much for your support.`],
    ['13:05', `And now 2019, hopefully – it's a pretty good year so far, but we'll see.`],
    ['13:12', `Anyway, the point was: Your failures will lead you to where you're meant to go,`],
    ['13:17', `so you should not be afraid to take the risk.`],
    ['13:21', `Just do it.`],
    ['13:23', `If you don't feel 100% aligned to what you're doing now, keep searching for it.`],
    ['13:29', `Talk to people, learn from others, test out little paths.`],
    ['13:33', `You don't have to quit your job.`],
    ['13:34', `You can have your job and really test out these side hustles on the side.`],
    ['13:39', `Test out new hobbies.`],
    ['13:40', `You never know until you actually try.`],
    ['13:44', `You don't know until you take action.`],
    ['13:46', `So the sun is almost setting, so I will wrap it up here,`],
    ['13:50', `but I hope you guys liked this chill car vlog.`],
    ['13:52', `I want to do more vlogs in my car.`],
    ['13:54', `I want to do more vlogs in general because I feel kind of stuffy doing my typical videos in my office.`],
    ['14:01', `And my house has been really messy lately because I've been working on the Create Your Dream Life course.`],
    ['14:06', `So when my space is messy, I don't like to film routine videos and things where I have to show the background.`],
    ['14:13', `So until I get my house clean and together, I won't shoot those videos.`],
    ['14:20', `I might even shoot a cleaning video because I need to get my space together, guys.`],
    ['14:26', `Alright, I will wrap it up here.`],
    ['14:27', `Love you guys so much and I will see you guys next time.`],
    ['14:31', `Bye!`],
    ['14:33', `Hi love!`],
