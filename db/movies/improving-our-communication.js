    ['00:00', `Communicating with people is something that we do all the time and it's so important.`],
    ['00:04', `How we approach somebody? How we talk to them?`],
    ['00:05', `Because it's going to affect how we make them feel.`],
    ['00:08', `And that's also gonna affect what they think of us.`],
    ['00:11', `[music]`],
    ['00:13', `I used to be somebody who was fairly nervous in social situations.`],
    ['00:17', `I feel like I never knew what I needed to say,`],
    ['00:19', `and of course we never know how people are perceiving us`],
    ['00:21', `That can be nerve-racking.`],
    ['00:22', `but one thing I've also noticed is these things are never as scary as we make them out to be in our heads.`],
    ['00:28', `So in today's video, we're going to explore a few simple and effective ways`],
    ['00:31', `that we can increase our confidence in social interactions`],
    ['00:34', `in ways that we can also build more meaningful connections with people.`],
    ['00:39', `[music]`],
    ['00:41', `One of the most nerve-racking things about social interactions is trying to figure out what we need to say,`],
    ['00:46', `And I think sometimes we feel like we have to be super funny and entertaining`],
    ['00:49', `in order to be confident and likable`],
    ['00:51', `but that's really not the case.`],
    ['00:53', `What can actually help to take off a lot of the pressure`],
    ['00:56', `is if we don't just talk, but if we listen instead`],
    ['00:59', `Asking people to talk about themselves,`],
    ['01:01', `encouraging them to keep speaking by asking thoughtful questions.`],
    ['01:04', `You see the secret to being interesting is to actually just be interested`],
    ['01:08', `but to be interested we have to fully listen.`],
    ['01:11', `So this also means,`],
    ['01:12', `not interrupting the person when they're talking,`],
    ['01:14', `not looking at our phones`],
    ['01:15', `or looking over their shoulder at something happening in the distance`],
    ['01:18', `cause that can be really distracting to them.`],
    ['01:20', `People feel most comfortable around us when we show genuine interest in them`],
    ['01:25', `and in the things that they're interested in.`],
    ['01:27', `[music]`],
    ['01:30', `We tend to subconsciously express how we feel through our body language.`],
    ['01:33', `So for feeling a little bit nervous, we tend to kind of close up,`],
    ['01:36', `we hunch the shoulders forward,`],
    ['01:37', `cross our arms, cross our legs`],
    ['01:39', `and that can in response make us actually feel timid`],
    ['01:42', `or at least when someone's looking at us,`],
    ['01:43', `they're gonna think that we're shy.`],
    ['01:45', `But if we open up our stance, standing tall, shoulders back, chin up,`],
    ['01:49', `it changes everything, it actually makes us feel more confident.`],
    ['01:53', `Smiling is another big one.`],
    ['01:55', `It's the first way we tell somebody we like them`],
    ['01:57', `and usually a smile is met with a smile. It's contagious.`],
    ['02:01', `Smiling also releases chemicals that make us feel happy,`],
    ['02:04', `even if we didn't feel that way to begin with,`],
    ['02:06', `so it's a win all around`],
    ['02:07', `Remember that our emotions are created by motion,`],
    ['02:11', `whether that's through physical movements or through our facial expressions.`],
    ['02:14', `[music]`],
    ['02:17', `One of the biggest drives that we humans have is to feel appreciated`],
    ['02:21', `and we tend to like people who share their appreciation with us a little bit more,`],
    ['02:25', `and this can be especially important if we're ever sharing feedback with somebody.`],
    ['02:29', `Let me give you an example.`],
    ['02:31', `When I was working as a dietitian,`],
    ['02:32', `it was my job to give people dietary advice`],
    ['02:34', `so I would often ask a patient or a client what they generally ate in a day so that I could assess`],
    ['02:40', `if their diet was balanced and adequate.`],
    ['02:42', `If I had any feedback to give or suggestions for what things might need to be modified,`],
    ['02:46', `I actually wouldn't offer it up right away.`],
    ['02:50', `First I would tell the person all of the things that they were doing really well.`],
    ['02:53', `That tended to make them smile and nod in confirmation`],
    ['02:56', `and it would help to build that connection.`],
    ['02:58', `Then when I would give my advice they tended to be more open to receiving it.`],
    ['03:02', `You see, when we give people feedback,`],
    ['03:03', `even if it's positive,`],
    ['03:05', `sometimes it can be viewed as criticism which can make people defensive.`],
    ['03:09', `So if you want to avoid that, try proceeding it with giving them some genuine praise.`],
    ['03:14', `And even if you aren't giving somebody feedback`],
    ['03:17', `just sharing your appreciation in general is one of the kindest things that we can do.`],
    ['03:21', `[music]`],
    ['03:24', `I had always been somebody who said that I was terrible at remembering names.`],
    ['03:27', `But because I said that,`],
    ['03:29', `I think I gave myself permission to let it become true`],
    ['03:32', `like, at some point,`],
    ['03:33', `I even stopped trying to remember people's names,`],
    ['03:36', `which is not very nice.`],
    ['03:37', `But then a few years ago,`],
    ['03:38', `I listened to this book on my commute.`],
    ['03:40', `It's a book that's now one of my all-time favorites`],
    ['03:43', `and was the inspiration for today's video`],
    ['03:44', `It's a book called "How to win friends and iInfluence people" by Dale Carnegie`],
    ['03:48', `It's not the best title for a book, I'll admit,`],
    ['03:51', `but it single-handedly improved the way I communicate with people now,`],
    ['03:54', `so I definitely do recommend it.`],
    ['03:56', `In the book, Dale mentions the importance of not only remembering people's names`],
    ['04:00', `but also actively using it in a conversation when you're talking with them.`],
    ['04:03', `A person's name is part of who they are and by saying it we acknowledge them`],
    ['04:07', `which makes them feel important`],
    ['04:09', `and that helps to build connection as well.`],
    ['04:11', `So, I ditched this idea of being bad at remembering names,`],
    ['04:14', `and now I actively use a person's name once or twice throughout a conversation`],
    ['04:18', `and I've noticed it's helped me remember their names but also helps to build that connection.`],
    ['04:22', `but if there's one thing I can recommend try to not overdo this one,`],
    ['04:26', `saying their name just once or twice is more than enough.`],
    ['04:28', `[music]`],
    ['04:32', `Confident and charismatic people tend to have a positive outlook on life,`],
    ['04:35', `but even if you're somebody who feels like`],
    ['04:37', `you're kind of having this consistently negative attitude,`],
    ['04:41', `remember that you can practice maintaining a positive outlook`],
    ['04:44', `We can condition our minds even if we don't believe in it at the start.`],
    ['04:48', `One thing that might help with this is writing down lists`],
    ['04:50', `Lists of our strengths, our achievement`],
    ['04:53', `A gratitude list can also help.`],
    ['04:56', `We tend to be drawn to people who are passionate, people who radiate positivity`],
    ['04:59', `It's like a moth being drawn to a flame.`],
    ['05:02', `We want some of that positivity to rub off on us.`],
    ['05:05', `And I want to emphasize one of the key messages with these tips is`],
    ['05:07', `you want to make sure you do them in a way that's genuine`],
    ['05:10', `We all have our down day`],
    ['05:11', `So if you're not feeling positive, you don't have to fake it,`],
    ['05:14', `just use this tip at your discretion`],
    ['05:15', `[music]`],
    ['05:18', `On that note if there's something that you can't be positive about`],
    ['05:22', `don't be afraid to be vulnerable either`],
    ['05:25', `Vulnerability is not a sign of weakness`],
    ['05:27', `In fact to think back to the last time that you were courageous`],
    ['05:30', `Chances are the last time you did something courageous`],
    ['05:32', `was also the last time in which you felt vulnerable`],
    ['05:35', `How I see it`],
    ['05:36', `Vulnerability is a measure of our courage`],
    ['05:39', `being vulnerable doesn't mean putting ourselves down`],
    ['05:41', `But it also doesn't mean being afraid to talk about our challenges`],
    ['05:44', `I personally noticed that when I've opened up about my challenges`],
    ['05:48', `It's helped to strengthen my relationships`],
    ['05:51', `it helps people feel like they can let their guard down and connect`],
    ['05:53', `So if I can summarize our level of confidence and ability to connect with people`],
    ['05:57', `it can happen in many ways through our body language`],
    ['06:01', `how we listen? how we communicate?`],
    ['06:03', `what we say? Our behavior and so on`],
    ['06:05', `It's also incredibly simple,`],
    ['06:07', `but I know that I've been guilty of not always putting it into practice`],
    ['06:09', `But it's so powerful when we do`],
    ['06:12', `I want to take a moment to thank audible for partnering with us on today's video`],
    ['06:15', `and if you feel like you want to improve your communication skills even more.`],
    ['06:19', `I really recommend Dale Carnegie's book`],
    ['06:21', `Which you can get for free`],
    ['06:22', `or you can get any other book of your choosing plus a 30-day free membership`],
    ['06:26', `if you visit audible.com`],
    ['06:27', `forward slash pick up lines or visit the link in the description box below`],
    ['06:31', `Audible members now also get one free audiobook per month plus two free audible originals`],
    ['06:35', `I think that's it for today`],
    ['06:36', `but I do hope that you enjoyed this little bit of moving around the studio`],
    ['06:39', `because it gives you a bit of a glimpse into what we've been working hard at here`],
    ['06:43', `if you enjoy the video it always shows us a lot of love and appreciation if you give the video a thumbs up`],
    ['06:48', `Thanks a lot for watching Pick Up Limes signing off. We'll see you in the next video.`]
