    ['00:05', `Which is better:`],
    ['00:06', `A lily or a rose?`],
    ['00:09', `If you ask anyone, the answer will depend on their taste.`],
    ['00:12', `They might think a rose is better, or maybe a lily.`],
    ['00:16', `Or neither.`],
    ['00:17', `You might think: Who cares?`],
    ['00:19', `And you’re right.`],
    ['00:20', `It’s not even a real argument.`],
    ['00:23', `But too often, it is.`],
    ['00:26', `The truth is, each flower has its own unique beauty and essence.`],
    ['00:30', `You simply cannot compare the two.`],
    ['00:33', `I may be a lily and she may be a rose.`],
    ['00:36', `Is a lily better than a rose?`],
    ['00:38', `Or a rose better than a lily?`],
    ['00:40', `There is no real answer.`],
    ['00:42', `You can’t compare.`],
    ['00:43', `A rose is beautiful, but its beauty does not diminish the beauty of a lily.`],
    ['00:49', `A lily does not shrivel down and lose its worth when compared to a rose.`],
    ['00:53', `Quite frankly, the rose and lily together might make an interesting bouquet.`],
    ['00:58', `Now, think of all the bouquets you’ve seen.`],
    ['01:01', `Each of them, beautiful in their own right.`],
    ['01:03', `A unique mix of flowers artfully crafted to complement and balance each other out.`],
    ['01:08', `Each flower is beautiful on its own, but there is a new kind of beauty`],
    ['01:13', `when you bring different flowers together and allow them to coexist,`],
    ['01:17', `complement and collaborate with each other.`],
    ['01:19', `There’s an enhanced value and beauty that you can’t really measure.`],
    ['01:23', `So if we’re talking about the rose or the lily, and which one is better,`],
    ['01:28', `let’s just say: A rose is beautiful.`],
    ['01:31', `And a lily is beautiful.`],
    ['01:32', `They’re incomparable and it’s a waste of time to even try to compare.`],
    ['01:37', `Instead, let the rose complement the lily, and the lily complement the rose.`],
    ['01:43', `Let them come together to create something even more beautiful.`],
    ['01:47', `The next time you catch yourself comparing yourself to others… remember this:`],
    ['01:51', `“A flower does not think about competing with the flower next to it.`],
    ['01:55', `A flower just blooms.”`],
    ['02:00', `Hey guys!`],
    ['02:02', `Continuing this self worth mini-series on my channel,`],
    ['02:04', `let's talk about how to stop comparing ourselves to others,`],
    ['02:08', `because this is something I feel like everybody does`],
    ['02:12', `and it's so detrimental to our mental health.`],
    ['02:14', `It just holds us back and makes us feel less than.`],
    ['02:17', `It makes us feel not good enough or not worthy, and it's not helpful.`],
    ['02:22', `So what we gotta do is become aware of why we do this and how to stop doing it.`],
    ['02:29', `You and I both know that social media has made it so easy to compare ourselves to others`],
    ['02:34', `because we see perfection every day on our feeds, whether it's beautiful women on Instagram`],
    ['02:41', `or your friend just graduated or got nominated on a Forbes list or has a best-selling book`],
    ['02:49', `– it doesn't matter.`],
    ['02:50', `People are killing it and they're posting their highlights and achievements and their best selves online,`],
    ['02:57', `that it gets so easy to look at that and look at your life,`],
    ['03:01', `and feel like, "Oh my god, what am I doing with my life?"`],
    ['03:04', `It just makes you feel bad about yourself, and you feel less than.`],
    ['03:07', `If you didn't see my previous video on self worth, self esteem, and insecurity,`],
    ['03:11', `I talked about how comparing yourself to others stems from all this conditioning that we had from our parents,`],
    ['03:18', `our schooling system, and society conditioning us to compare ourselves to others.`],
    ['03:24', `Maybe your parents would compare you to your siblings or your cousins or people on TV.`],
    ['03:30', `And same thing in school: you felt compared to with your peers.`],
    ['03:34', `And now that we have access to the internet and social media, we see the best of the best,`],
    ['03:41', `the highlight reel of the best, the prettiest, the smartest people out there.`],
    ['03:46', `And we're like, "Well, what about me?"`],
    ['03:49', `You tend to compare yourself and it's just not doing you any good.`],
    ['03:52', `Always remember that comparison is the thief of joy,`],
    ['03:57', `because you might be feeling good about yourself.`],
    ['04:00', `You might make a small win – maybe you did really well on your test recently,`],
    ['04:04', `and you're feeling good about yourself, feeling good about life.`],
    ['04:07', `And then you open up social media and someone else does something even more epic.`],
    ['04:10', `And you're like, "Oh, well in comparison, what I did was not as cool as what they did,`],
    ['04:16', `and now I'm back to feeling bad about myself."`],
    ['04:17', `If you look at the world that way, you are always going to find someone who's than you at something.`],
    ['04:24', `Just when you thought you were the best, you'll find someone who's better and that's just how the world is.`],
    ['04:29', `But on the flip side, there's always someone who's worse than you.`],
    ['04:33', `So there's always someone better, someone worse than you in a specific area of life,`],
    ['04:39', `and I just feel like you can't judge people that way.`],
    ['04:42', `You can't categorize life that way because if you really open up the spectrum of life,`],
    ['04:48', `if you look at the big picture, each person lives such a unique life –`],
    ['04:52', `they have such a unique story, unique upbringing,`],
    ['04:56', `unique strengths, skills, talents, weaknesses –`],
    ['05:00', `that if you're comparing yourself to a separate person,`],
    ['05:04', `it's impossible to compare side-by-side because you're both so different.`],
    ['05:08', `You came from different backgrounds.`],
    ['05:10', `One person's better at this, you're better at that.`],
    ['05:13', `It's just not a fair comparison and it's not doing you any service to compare yourself that way.`],
    ['05:18', `I'm not saying that comparison is completely bad because in some cases, comparison is helpful.`],
    ['05:23', `It can be beneficial to your life if you're seeing what others are doing.`],
    ['05:27', `You can learn from them, you can be inspired by them.`],
    ['05:29', `I think when comparison hurts you is what we really need to be looking at.`],
    ['05:35', `There's a difference in whether comparison is helpful or not helpful,`],
    ['05:40', `and it all boils down to your foundation of self worth.`],
    ['05:43', `If you are a person that does not feel worthy, you have low self esteem,`],
    ['05:49', `then seeing other people's success will make you feel less than, sad –`],
    ['05:54', `it'll make you feel bad about yourself.`],
    ['05:56', `It's just gonna bring you down, and it's not helpful.`],
    ['06:00', `And that's the type of comparison that I'm addressing in this video, what we're going to try to overcome.`],
    ['06:05', `But if you are a person who feels worthy, who's super confident and has high esteem,`],
    ['06:11', `then seeing other people's success is going to inspire you and motivate you`],
    ['06:15', `and show you that it's possible to get there because they did it, meaning you can do it too – and it's positive.`],
    ['06:22', `Do you see the difference in comparison?`],
    ['06:25', `You can be comparing yourself to people and it can hurt you, if you have low self esteem.`],
    ['06:30', `But if you have higher self worth and self esteem,`],
    ['06:33', `then seeing that same person will have a positive effect on you,`],
    ['06:36', `then you can learn to improve and be inspired by them.`],
    ['06:41', `So it all boils down to working on yourself.`],
    ['06:45', `If you want to stop comparing yourself to others in a way that hurts you,`],
    ['06:49', `then you have to look within and ask yourself,`],
    ['06:52', `"Okay, why do I not feel worthy?`],
    ['06:54', `Why do I not feel good enough?`],
    ['06:56', `Why am I insecure?"`],
    ['06:57', `Again, I'm going to refer you to the previous video because I really broke it down,`],
    ['07:01', `how to build up your self worth and how to overcome your insecurities,`],
    ['07:06', `because once you have a stronger sense of self worth,`],
    ['07:09', `then you're not going to be as hurt by seeing what other people are doing`],
    ['07:14', `because you stand strong in yourself and you know that,`],
    ['07:17', `regardless of what's happening in the external world, you're good.`],
    ['07:21', `You love yourself and you're strong.`],
    ['07:23', `Another point that I have to make is:`],
    ['07:25', `So often, we let other people's success and other people's light diminish our own.`],
    ['07:31', `We shrink ourselves next to people that we think are better than us.`],
    ['07:37', `We shrink ourselves because we're like, "Oh my god, this person is so amazing … and I am not worthy.`],
    ['07:43', `I'm not on the same level as them."`],
    ['07:45', `Reality check: There are no levels in terms of who's worthier than the other person,`],
    ['07:51', `who's better than the other person because like I mentioned, everyone's unique.`],
    ['07:55', `Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and you just can't compare one person to another.`],
    ['08:01', `You just cannot.`],
    ['08:02', `What we need to do is stop shrinking ourselves and feeling less than other people`],
    ['08:07', `because we are just as worthy, and we should stop attacking people out of insecurity.`],
    ['08:14', `Some people, when they're insecure, they attack on people who are successful`],
    ['08:19', `and seem like they have it all together and they inherently want to bring them down.`],
    ['08:24', `And that is just not healthy because that just stems from your own insecurity.`],
    ['08:28', `You think that you are down here and when you see someone doing well in life,`],
    ['08:31', `you want to bring them down?`],
    ['08:33', `It happens.`],
    ['08:35', `What you have to realize is that one person's success, beauty, light,`],
    ['08:40', `strengths, gifts, talents, everything, does not diminish what you have.`],
    ['08:45', `You are unique.`],
    ['08:46', `You have your own set of strengths, gifts, talents, life experience.`],
    ['08:52', `Everything that makes you amazing, beautiful, and so worthy, it is your own.`],
    ['08:58', `Nobody else has the exact copy of what you have, and so you are worthy.`],
    ['09:03', `Don't feel diminished by other people's worth and other people's light`],
    ['09:07', `because what we should do instead is support each other.`],
    ['09:12', `It's not a competition, it's a community.`],
    ['09:15', `And if you think about it in terms of the flowers,`],
    ['09:19', `different types of flowers are all inherently beautiful and worthy in their own way.`],
    ['09:25', `And some people might prefer certain types of flowers over others and that's okay`],
    ['09:28', `because it's just a matter of taste.`],
    ['09:31', `But the power is when you bring a bouquet of flowers together: different flowers,`],
    ['09:36', `and they come together as a community to make something bigger and better,`],
    ['09:41', `more beautiful than they were when they were standing alone.`],
    ['09:46', `And that's the same as with people.`],
    ['09:48', `When we come together as a community, we work together and lift each other up –`],
    ['09:52', `rather than competing and comparing ourselves to each other and bringing each other down –`],
    ['09:58', `the world just functions so much better, and with more positivity and more love and support.`],
    ['10:04', `And that's what we need.`],
    ['10:05', `We need to stop comparing ourselves to each other in the sense that the world is a competition`],
    ['10:11', `and you're trying to be better than the other, but rather just look within, work on yourself.`],
    ['10:18', `Find it in yourself to work on your self love, to boost your self worth, and to truly believe in yourself.`],
    ['10:25', `That is your duty as a human being and a soul on this planet,`],
    ['10:30', `is to learn to believe in yourself and your own worth.`],
    ['10:33', `And only then can you feel at a good place to lift each other up.`],
    ['10:38', `So just work on yourself.`],
    ['10:39', `Know that you cannot be compared to anyone else.`],
    ['10:42', `The only comparison you should be doing is with your older self.`],
    ['10:46', `You want to constantly be improving and better than the you that you were yesterday.`],
    ['10:50', `But outside of that, the journey is here within,`],
    ['10:53', `and once you get to a good place, you'll notice the shift in your thinking.`],
    ['10:57', `When you see other people succeed, it inspires you and motivates you, rather than making you feel less than.`],
    ['11:03', `I'm going to share an exercise that you guys can do to reprogram your mind to stop comparing`],
    ['11:09', `and stop that negative self talk and criticism, and rather:`],
    ['11:12', `flip it, rewrite it for positive thinking and thinking thoughts that support you.`],
    ['11:18', `You want to monitor your thoughts for the next three days.`],
    ['11:22', `Keep a journal close to you or just write it in your phone.`],
    ['11:26', `Whenever you notice yourself comparing yourself to someone else, write it down.`],
    ['11:31', `Write down: What was it that triggered your comparison thought?`],
    ['11:36', `What was the exact thought that you thought?`],
    ['11:39', `What were the words that you used in your head?`],
    ['11:42', `Just keep note of this for three days.`],
    ['11:46', `And after the three days is up, you'll have a list of the times`],
    ['11:49', `that you compared yourself with others and felt less than and felt insecure.`],
    ['11:54', `After you have your list of negative thoughts that you're thinking,`],
    ['11:57', `it's time to refute and rewrite those negative thoughts into positive ones`],
    ['12:02', `that actually help you and serve you in your life.`],
    ['12:05', `With each negative thought – and you'll notice that`],
    ['12:07', `it tends to be the same recurring thoughts about yourself,`],
    ['12:10', `like "I'm not pretty enough. I'm not worthy. I'm not good enough".`],
    ['12:15', `Whatever it may be, you'll notice patterns and you can start to literally change that thought,`],
    ['12:22', `replace it with a positive one and repeat those positive thoughts.`],
    ['12:26', `Literally drill it into your mind by repeating them every morning, every evening.`],
    ['12:32', `Keep them as a positive affirmations list on your phone`],
    ['12:35', `so that you refer to it as often as you can,`],
    ['12:38', `because the way to reprogram your thoughts is to:`],
    ['12:41', `Step 1) Become aware of them, and Step 2) Actually decide to change,`],
    ['12:46', `because your mind is powerful but you have control over your mind if you choose to do that.`],
    ['12:54', `And it's just a matter of changing your mind.`],
    ['12:56', `Sounds easy – I mean it could be easy or hard, depending on how you want to look at it.`],
    ['13:01', `What you're essentially doing is retraining your thought patterns.`],
    ['13:04', `And it's similar to building a new habit.`],
    ['13:07', `You guys know how to build a new habit, hopefully you watched my habit series.`],
    ['13:11', `You just start with one habit and work on the repetition and the consistency of that habit.`],
    ['13:18', `And if you fall off, just forgive yourself and try again when you can.`],
    ['13:23', `It's the same thing with these thoughts.`],
    ['13:25', `You're not going to be perfect.`],
    ['13:26', `You're going to find yourself slipping into those negative thoughts and self criticisms.`],
    ['13:32', `But you now have the tools to rewrite those thoughts,`],
    ['13:34', `and you have the positive affirmations that you can just repeat to yourself again and again.`],
    ['13:40', `I talked about this in my morning habits video, that the best times to reprogram your thoughts`],
    ['13:46', `and your subconscious mind is right before you fall asleep, and right upon waking.`],
    ['13:51', `Other times are: during meditation and sometimes even during exercise.`],
    ['13:56', `Anyway, I'll post links to articles about that because it has to do with neuroscience`],
    ['14:01', `and the state that your brain is in during those activities.`],
    ['14:05', `I believe it's called theta brain state.`],
    ['14:08', `I'm not a scientist, I'm not an expert on this, but I do know that repetition works, okay?`],
    ['14:15', `So give it a try and let me know how it goes.`],
    ['14:18', `And let me know your comments down below,`],
    ['14:20', `if you have any tips and tricks for people to stop comparing themselves to others.`],
    ['14:24', `For example: Get off social media.`],
    ['14:28', `If you notice a specific app or a specific account that just makes you feel bad about yourself, just cut it out.`],
    ['14:34', `Literally cut it out.`],
    ['14:35', `Get off, unfollow, do what you have to do to distance yourself from it`],
    ['14:39', `and try to build up those better, positive habits,`],
    ['14:43', `positive thoughts on the way to a better life,`],
    ['14:46', `so that you're not held back by comparing yourself to others,`],
    ['14:49', `because seriously, we are better when we each believe in ourselves`],
    ['14:55', `and when we can work together, when we can support and lift each other up.`],
    ['15:00', `So that's the goal with all of this.`],
    ['15:02', `Love you guys so much.`],
    ['15:04', `Let me know what you think of these self worth videos lately`],
    ['15:06', `and if you have any topics or suggestions for the future, leave them down below.`],
