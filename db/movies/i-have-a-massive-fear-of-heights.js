    ['00:01', `Fear.`],
    ['00:03', `Like the rolling mist, it can obscure your vision leaving you blindly stumbling through the forest.`],
    ['00:20', `I have a deathly fear of heights.`],
    ['00:22', `This is a fear that has followed me my entire life`],
    ['00:25', `and sometimes I'll have this nightmare where I'm falling from the sky`],
    ['00:29', `straight towards the zooming earth.`],
    ['00:31', `Fear clouds our judgement and it turns us into animals.`],
    ['00:34', `It has this effect of closing in around you,`],
    ['00:37', `but it's my belief that`],
    ['00:38', `it is your duty as a human being on this planet to face your fears,`],
    ['00:42', `to look them straight in the eye and say:`],
    ['00:44', `"You're not gonna beat me."`],
    ['00:46', `So I'd like to share a story that I think might help.`],
    ['00:49', `Last year I spent a couple of weeks in Costa Rica`],
    ['00:52', `for a project that I was shooting and directing,`],
    ['00:54', `and it was a really cool experience.`],
    ['00:56', `You have to understand I had never been to a place`],
    ['00:59', `with that level of wildness,`],
    ['01:01', `of nature and biodiversity.`],
    ['01:03', `I generally get excited when I'm in a place that feels very foreign.`],
    ['01:06', `It feels like it's new.`],
    ['01:11', `I was there to film a couple of scientists`],
    ['01:12', `that do their work taking samples in the trees`],
    ['01:15', `like a hundred plus feet up in the air.`],
    ['01:18', `At that height the branches moved with the wind.`],
    ['01:20', `You literally sway in the air and on top of it,`],
    ['01:23', `at the altitude where I was`],
    ['01:25', `the clouds can just roll right in and engulf you.`],
    ['01:27', `Now, we needed to capture a scene of the`],
    ['01:29', `scientists doing their work up in the trees`],
    ['01:32', `and I was the videographer on this project.`],
    ['01:34', `Now, I could have told the scientists to go up with my GoPro,`],
    ['01:37', `I could have maybe shot things from above with my drone,`],
    ['01:40', `and these were ideas that I considered but`],
    ['01:42', `at the end of the day I was there to do my job,`],
    ['01:45', `and it was my responsibility to do the best that I possibly could.`],
    ['01:48', `Taking one of these easier options wouldn't have been`],
    ['01:52', `doing my very best.`],
    ['01:54', `We scouted the location the day before shooting`],
    ['01:56', `and I remember going back to the Airbnb`],
    ['01:59', `and feeling sick to my stomach at the idea of what was to come.`],
    ['02:02', `I felt physically ill.`],
    ['02:04', `I was afraid of a lot of things growing up,`],
    ['02:06', `but my fear of heights trumped everything.`],
    ['02:08', `You guys don't understand, leaning over a balcony on the second floor of a building makes me dizzy,`],
    ['02:13', `it makes my palms sweat.`],
    ['02:15', `I can't go on rollercoasters.`],
    ['02:16', `I've never gone bungee jumping and even just the thought of it puts a pit in my stomach.`],
    ['02:20', `I remember the morning came`],
    ['02:22', `It was all kind of a blur.`],
    ['02:24', `Gearing up, preparing the equipment, and before I knew it,`],
    ['02:27', `there was no more time to fuzz around.`],
    ['02:29', `There's a quote by Seneca the Younger, a Roman stoic philosopher,`],
    ['02:33', `and it's a quote that has often helped bring me back to earth.`],
    ['02:37', `He said: "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality."`],
    ['02:41', `And with that I began my ascend.`],
    ['02:52', `For only a few feet I decided that I couldn't look down.`],
    ['02:56', `I didn't want my courage to evaporate.`],
    ['03:02', `With every little movement of the rope`],
    ['03:04', `adrenaline seeped into my veins.`],
    ['03:10', `When you're in that state your thoughts are completely irrational.`],
    ['03:14', `I kept envisioning absurd fatal scenarios.`],
    ['03:29', `But you know what? They're just thoughts.`],
    ['03:31', `I might be consumed completely in panic for the moment,`],
    ['03:34', `but then it would pass and I would still be there, alive.`],
    ['03:40', `I was still dangling among the trees in a forest somewhere in Central America.`],
    ['03:46', `I had to surrender.`],
    ['03:55', `Two things helped me avoid losing my nerve.`],
    ['03:58', `The first was just taking things one step at a time.`],
    ['04:01', `Just climb one foot, one foot at a time.`],
    ['04:04', `I'll figure out the rest later.`],
    ['04:05', `And the second is not stopping for too long. You don't want to lose your momentum.`],
    ['04:09', `You don't want to let your irrational thoughts get too far along.`],
    ['04:17', `Eventually, by some miracle`],
    ['04:19', `I made it to the top.`],
    ['04:20', `And the guy that was helping guide me along`],
    ['04:23', `had me sit on a branch way up in the air.`],
    ['04:46', `Up to that point,`],
    ['04:47', `I had had one foot in a sort of like buckle`],
    ['04:50', `that I was able to place half of my weight on as I climbed my way up.`],
    ['04:55', `There was a moment where I swung my leg over the branch`],
    ['04:58', `to kind of straddle it.`],
    ['05:13', `However, when I straddled that branch,`],
    ['05:15', `I had both legs dangling in the open air for the first time.`],
    ['05:19', `Suddenly there was no air in my lungs,`],
    ['05:21', `I grew lightheaded, and I came this close to passing out.`],
    ['05:30', `The sensation of having absolutely nothing beneath my feet was terrifying.`],
    ['05:59', `But you know what's amazing?`],
    ['06:01', `If you close your eyes, and are able to shut out the world around you,`],
    ['06:05', `you'll realize that it's all in the mind.`],
    ['06:08', `It's all imaginary.`],
    ['06:10', `Coming back down I had probably the greatest sense of`],
    ['06:13', `relief that I've ever felt.`],
    ['06:16', `I kissed the ground when I made it finally all the way back down.`],
    ['06:20', `And you know what?`],
    ['06:22', `I could probably do it again.`],
    ['06:23', `Now, I'm sure a lot of you guys don't have this problem.`],
    ['06:26', `A lot of you don't have an issue with heights at all,`],
    ['06:29', `and so this might seem silly but,`],
    ['06:33', `I don't really care about that, to be honest with you.`],
    ['06:35', `This still feels like a great accomplishment, and I'm so glad that I didn't let my fear`],
    ['06:40', `stop me from having an amazing life experience.`],
    ['06:43', `So yeah, thank you for watching.`],
    ['06:45', `I hope that this video was able to give you a little bit of courage if you're afraid of something,`],
    ['06:49', `whatever it is.`],
    ['06:50', `I'll keep this short.`],
    ['06:51', `You can follow my adventures on Instagram or through my newsletter`],
    ['06:54', `and you can support this project and get access to bonus content`],
    ['06:57', `on my Patreon page for less than the price of San Francisco ramen.`],
    ['07:01', `That's kind of a weird analogy.`],
    ['07:03', `but I thought it would I thought it would be a good way to sort of, I don't know.`],
    ['07:07', `Don't let fear beat you.`],
    ['07:08', `I'll see you soon.`]
