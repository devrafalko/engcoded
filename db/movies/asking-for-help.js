    ['00:00', `good Monday morning today I would like`],
    ['00:03', `to talk a little bit and muse a little`],
    ['00:04', `bit on something that I think is one of`],
    ['00:07', `the absolutely hardest things as a`],
    ['00:09', `software developer at least for me`],
    ['00:12', `personally and that is asking for help`],
    ['00:15', `so uh still here in Stockholm and I'm`],
    ['00:23', `gonna be for a while moving here we I`],
    ['00:27', `talked a little bit about how we are`],
    ['00:30', `going to do more of these live more`],
    ['00:32', `programming shows but that's not gonna`],
    ['00:35', `start in awhile because we are still`],
    ['00:37', `looking for a studio space and in the`],
    ['00:40', `meantime there's gonna be a lot of these`],
    ['00:42', `walking talks which I know a lot of you`],
    ['00:44', `like and I like doing them and I feel`],
    ['00:48', `like this month is a bit of a musing one`],
    ['00:51', `there's like a start of the new year I'm`],
    ['00:59', `gonna talk about three different`],
    ['01:02', `approaches to how asking for help and`],
    ['01:06', `giving help as handled in in software`],
    ['01:09', `teams and my experience like three`],
    ['01:12', `different ways we're in three different`],
    ['01:16', `ways that I've acted and how the teams`],
    ['01:20', `are been in have acted and the first one`],
    ['01:23', `is basically as having no technique at`],
    ['01:28', `all in it like it's basically when`],
    ['01:32', `you're doing code archaeology and then`],
    ['01:35', `the new person he's just thrown into the`],
    ['01:37', `code base we're very little assistance`],
    ['01:40', `second I'm gonna talk about something`],
    ['01:43', `that I've come to refer to as a buddy`],
    ['01:45', `system where you're assigned a person or`],
    ['01:48', `a mentor if you will that has some time`],
    ['01:52', `allocated to help you to figure out the`],
    ['01:54', `project and finally I'm gonna talk about`],
    ['01:56', `my personal favorite which is pair`],
    ['01:59', `programming and mob programming where`],

    ['02:12', `today`],
    ['02:16', `okay so first approach first approach to`],
    ['02:20', `help in a software team and it's`],
    ['02:22', `basically no help or very little help`],
    ['02:24', `help when you're desperate it's it's`],

    ['02:45', `you have no idea what is happening`],
    ['02:49', `you open the the code base and you have`],
    ['02:52', `perhaps a task that you're gonna do`],
    ['02:55', `perhaps it's vague and you just try to`],
    ['02:58', `figure out wildly in the in the code`],
    ['03:01', `where is this thing and what is this`],
    ['03:03', `thing and you poke around a little bit`],

    ['03:09', `idea`],

    ['03:15', `there's no and there's no like overview`],
    ['03:18', `document or like unit test or anything`],
    ['03:20', `and you basically define things out you`],
    ['03:26', `if you're a little lucky you can walk`],
    ['03:28', `around in their organization and try to`],
    ['03:30', `like kindly ask people that maybe could`],
    ['03:33', `you perhaps explain this piece of code`],
    ['03:36', `and they are like oh yeah yeah sure but`],
    ['03:38', `you're sensing that oh god they're`],
    ['03:41', `stressed with their own and now I'm`],
    ['03:42', `demanding their time and it's just like`],
    ['03:45', `it's an excruciating ly screwed`],
    ['03:51', `excruciatingly ly slow way of working`],
    ['03:54', `you're basically doing archaeology it's`],
    ['03:57', `it's your work is not really productive`],
    ['04:00', `team work it's more like you're trying`],
    ['04:04', `digging out like an ancient civilization`],
    ['04:06', `with a little brush you have to do`],
    ['04:08', `everything so carefully all the time you`],

    ['04:49', `well-functioning software team works the`],
    ['04:52', `more well-functioning teams that I`],
    ['04:54', `worked in have sometimes work with`],

    ['05:02', `about`],
    ['05:06', `the buddy system is what it sounds like`],
    ['05:11', `you're it happened to me the first time`],
    ['05:15', `I I don't Spotify where I was assigned a`],
    ['05:18', `body which was named Martin that he he`],
    ['05:22', `turned out to be a good friend like`],
    ['05:24', `eventually over it Spotify as well it`],
    ['05:26', `was like such a super nice guy but the`],
    ['05:32', `the body is basically this person that`],
    ['05:37', `they have been allocate a located time`],
    ['05:40', `from their normal work duties to to help`],
    ['05:43', `you like they're like yeah we know`],
    ['05:45', `you're gonna help this new developer on`],
    ['05:48', `the project and we we are expecting you`],
    ['05:53', `to not move as fast as a result because`],
    ['05:56', `you're gonna make yourself available to`],
    ['05:58', `them you're gonna be interrupted all the`],
    ['06:00', `time and that's the way it's gonna be`],
    ['06:02', `and you are also and this is important`],
    ['06:06', `you are also expected to encourage your`],
    ['06:11', `new developer to interrupt you and to`],
    ['06:14', `ask you questions because I think it's`],
    ['06:18', `very important here to address that it's`],
    ['06:20', `not natural to want to ask questions`],
    ['06:22', `when you're in a in a new position like`],
    ['06:25', `you you very much feel the need to prove`],
    ['06:28', `yourself that you can take care of these`],
    ['06:31', `things and that you won't like I'm a`],
    ['06:33', `good developer I must like you might`],
    ['06:35', `even be a senior developer actually like`],
    ['06:38', `just because you're new in a code base`],
    ['06:40', `or or a project or or perhaps a library`],
    ['06:45', `that you're working on but you're`],
    ['06:47', `unfamiliar with that you might be very`],
    ['06:49', `senior and in those cases it's even`],
    ['06:52', `harder to ask for help sometimes because`],
    ['06:54', `you have worked for the in in this field`],
    ['06:58', `for so long or perhaps in this company`],
    ['07:00', `for so long and it just feels like you`],
    ['07:02', `should you should magically know it`],
    ['07:04', `which is absurd of course but that's`],
    ['07:06', `what it feels like so you don't ask for`],
    ['07:08', `help for you wait wave too long to ask`],
    ['07:11', `for help you just waste half a day to`],
    ['07:14', `figure something out that when you ask`],
    ['07:17', `the person they like they say like no no`],
    ['07:19', `you`],
    ['07:20', `couldn't possibly have figured that out`],
    ['07:21', `it's because this thing that happened`],
    ['07:23', `two years ago before you joined where`],
    ['07:28', `this customer asked for this and this`],
    ['07:29', `and this and you like okay now this`],
    ['07:32', `makes sense why you did it this way and`],
    ['07:36', `it's it's easy to fall into the trap`],
    ['07:39', `like of banging your head against things`],
    ['07:43', `for too long I mean I often talk about`],
    ['07:46', `how software development is about that`],
    ['07:48', `about solving that that software`],
    ['07:52', `development is about banging your head`],
    ['07:54', `against the problem till it breaks and`],
    ['07:56', `it's a lot about tenacity but it's it's`],
    ['08:01', `also about also about asking for help`],
    ['08:05', `because there there is you cannot just`],
    ['08:11', `into it yourself into knowledge that`],
    ['08:15', `only exists in the heads of your`],
    ['08:19', `colleagues you don't know the history of`],
    ['08:21', `the organization you don't know the`],
    ['08:24', `general patterns used in this project`],
    ['08:26', `you don't know that yet but your`],
    ['08:28', `colleagues might so make sure that you`],
    ['08:30', `use them even though it might be feel`],
    ['08:34', `unintuitive because you want to prove`],
    ['08:35', `yourself`],
    ['08:40', `you think it's safe like they like he's`],
    ['08:42', `walking with this kid over there all`],
    ['08:45', `right all right in case you didn't catch`],
    ['08:59', `it yet we're walking on the ice in the`],
    ['09:01', `middle Stockholm all right oh yeah the`],
    ['09:16', `buddy system so the body system is it's`],
    ['09:19', `great it's easy to implement and there's`],
    ['09:26', `nothing wrong with it but I think that`],
    ['09:29', `the best best thing that I've always`],
    ['09:32', `experienced in all software projects`],
    ['09:35', `where that has always been absolutely`],
    ['09:37', `marvelous when I've done it is pair`],
    ['09:39', `programming and pair program for the`],
    ['09:43', `ones that you're not from aren't`],
    ['09:45', `familiar with it is when one person acts`],
    ['09:49', `as a navigator and one person acts as a`],
    ['09:52', `driver and the responsibility of the`],
    ['09:55', `driver is the one that is actually`],
    ['09:57', `holding the keyboard like has the hands`],
    ['10:01', `on the keyboard and type the code while`],
    ['10:06', `the Navigator is the person that is`],
    ['10:07', `keeping tabs a little bit more on the`],
    ['10:10', `direction and where you are in the`],
    ['10:11', `project and what you're supposed to do`],
    ['10:13', `like that you're not getting distracted`],
    ['10:15', `and like that person a little it's a`],
    ['10:18', `little less focused on syntax and and`],
    ['10:21', `typing and more focused on architecture`],
    ['10:24', `and getting the task done and in the I`],
    ['10:32', `think it's very very useful to have a`],
    ['10:36', `navigator that is familiar with the`],
    ['10:40', `project and the driver being the one`],
    ['10:43', `unfamiliar with the project and that's a`],
    ['10:45', `very good way of being introduced to the`],
    ['10:47', `project like the Navigator can`],
    ['10:50', `constantly assist you in saying like`],
    ['10:53', `yeah now we're gonna change like this`],
    ['10:55', `little part in the system and this`],
    ['10:57', `little part in the system do you think`],
    ['10:58', `that you can type it like figure out how`],
    ['11:00', `to do this here and like gradually`],
    ['11:03', `assist you through things and I find`],
    ['11:08', `that even even if you put a pair`],
    ['11:12', `programming inside and just talk about`],
    ['11:14', `the concept of code review code review`],
    ['11:17', `is one of the best best ways to`],
    ['11:20', `introduce people to a new code base like`],
    ['11:23', `I think that code many miss that`],
    ['11:26', `knowledge sharing is one of the greatest`],
    ['11:28', `benefits of code review like you're`],
    ['11:30', `pushing like you're a fix and then`],
    ['11:33', `people can say like yeah this is great I`],
    ['11:36', `understand where you thought this way`],
    ['11:37', `but we already have this library that`],
    ['11:41', `you can use to do this or this way of`],
    ['11:45', `doing it is great but it's not idiomatic`],
    ['11:47', `to what we do in the project so if you`],
    ['11:49', `do it look at this part of the code you`],
    ['11:51', `can see how we did about how we do it in`],
    ['11:54', `the project and that makes it more`],
    ['11:56', `consistent and easier to deal with it's`],
    ['11:59', `not that your height your way is bad but`],
    ['12:02', `it's just nice to have things consistent`],
    ['12:05', `and have that kind of no one sharing if`],
    ['12:06', `you don't do code review and your team`],
    ['12:08', `that doesn't happen and one of the`],
    ['12:12', `nicest things about but pair programming`],
    ['12:16', `pair pair programming pair program is`],
    ['12:19', `that you're doing code review all the`],
    ['12:22', `time all the time it's happening all the`],
    ['12:24', `time every second and in the same way`],
    ['12:29', `pair programming also means that you're`],
    ['12:31', `helping all the time in the in the`],
    ['12:35', `archaeology pattern you're you're`],
    ['12:38', `basically just asking for help at a`],
    ['12:41', `point where it's like so obvious that`],
    ['12:43', `you have been stuck maybe maybe you've`],
    ['12:46', `been stuck for days and tell you you`],
    ['12:48', `actually go and get make time with it`],
    ['12:51', `where perhaps a lead architect or`],
    ['12:53', `something`],
    ['12:54', `it can waste a lot of time and the body`],
    ['12:57', `system is also I mean it can still take`],
    ['13:00', `a lot of time I mean I try to say that`],
    ['13:03', `when I have access to a body I still try`],
    ['13:06', `to`],
    ['13:07', `not interrupt them constantly I try to`],
    ['13:10', `like still have a little time limit on`],
    ['13:14', `myself like just arbitrary like 50`],
    ['13:18', `minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes just`],
    ['13:20', `like some kind of time box where I'm not`],
    ['13:22', `allowed I'm not allowing myself to get`],
    ['13:24', `stuck more than that and then I ask`],
    ['13:27', `because even though the person is is`],
    ['13:30', `allocated to me and have time allocated`],
    ['13:33', `to me I guess I can't it's it's not`],
    ['13:36', `designed to allow me to interrupt them`],
    ['13:39', `at every single single point however`],
    ['13:44', `when it comes to pair programming you`],
    ['13:46', `have like this massive constant access`],
    ['13:49', `to a person where the person can help`],
    ['13:51', `you at any time I mean it's still good`],
    ['13:54', `for the navigator to allow the driver if`],
    ['13:56', `the driver is new in the project to to`],
    ['13:58', `figure things out on their own for a`],
    ['14:00', `little bit like it it's not a lot like`],
    ['14:03', `it's not good to like basically type for`],
    ['14:06', `the person verbally like typebar like`],
    ['14:09', `that's not good navigating but it's`],
    ['14:12', `really good that to have a navigator`],
    ['14:15', `that it's like okay you're getting stuck`],
    ['14:17', `can I give you a hint and that is`],
    ['14:21', `marvelously productive when I'm doing`],
    ['14:25', `pair programming it is so extremely rare`],
    ['14:29', `to get properly stuck but properly stuck`],
    ['14:33', `I mean when you are just you have no`],
    ['14:36', `idea how Pro to progress you just you`],
    ['14:40', `have been staring at the code for`],
    ['14:43', `perhaps hours and you don't know what's`],
    ['14:46', `wrong you move things around and you`],
    ['14:49', `just don't see the issue and then you`],
    ['14:52', `perhaps you just give up go home and`],
    ['14:54', `then you come back the next day and look`],
    ['14:57', `at it with fresh eyes or perhaps you`],
    ['14:59', `just have a co-worker over and have them`],
    ['15:01', `look at it and you figure out the`],
    ['15:03', `problem immediately because it was just`],
    ['15:05', `some little thing missing it just was`],
    ['15:08', `invisible to you it was obvious in`],
    ['15:10', `hindsight but yeah and with pair`],
    ['15:13', `programming I almost never find myself`],
    ['15:17', `in those situations it's so`],
    ['15:20', `because the likelihood that two people`],
    ['15:23', `two different brains looking at the same`],
    ['15:26', `code that they would miss the same`],
    ['15:30', `problem is so incredibly unlikely and`],
    ['15:34', `it's even more unlikely if you're doing`],
    ['15:36', `mob programming where you have an entire`],
    ['15:37', `team being like The Navigators I haven't`],
    ['15:42', `done that too much but it's super cool`],
    ['15:44', `and yeah I like pair programming a lot`],
    ['15:49', `so those are the three things like the`],
    ['15:52', `three ways I think about when I think`],
    ['15:56', `about asking for help and giving help in`],
    ['15:58', `a software team like the the archaeology`],
    ['16:03', `pattern or technique where you you don't`],
    ['16:06', `don't really you don't have access to`],
    ['16:09', `much help maybe like you just have to`],
    ['16:12', `like Oh as the senior architecture pay`],
    ['16:16', `me you can help me and but you feel bad`],
    ['16:19', `about it and then you have the buddy`],
    ['16:22', `system where you are allocated a person`],
    ['16:24', `and then you have the pair programming`],
    ['16:26', `system where like you're actually always`],
    ['16:29', `sitting down with somebody more familiar`],
    ['16:32', `with the code that's in you and you you`],
    ['16:34', `figure things out together in unison`],
    ['16:38', `finally I I would like to make a little`],
    ['16:42', `plea to software`],
    ['16:45', `it's senior software developers or`],
    ['16:48', `rather people that are in in senior`],
    ['16:50', `positions that you've been in a company`],
    ['16:52', `for a while but when a new person joins`],
    ['16:57', `your team or your company or where some`],
    ['16:59', `Orban it might be a new develop new`],
    ['17:02', `developer a junior developer it might be`],
    ['17:04', `a senior developer helping out with the`],
