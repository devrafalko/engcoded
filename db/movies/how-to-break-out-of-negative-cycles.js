    ['00:08', `Depression comes up and I just don't feel like I can speak about it with any real authority. All I can really talk about are`],
    ['00:14', `my experiences`],
    ['00:15', `However, I do want to talk about this because to never bring this kind of thing up`],
    ['00:19', `Especially on social media feels a little bit negligent to me. I want to see human beings. I don't want to see`],
    ['00:25', `Perfect people all the time. I feel like whenever I've fallen into a negative cycle. It's almost like the rules change`],
    ['00:31', `You know, I'm not thinking clearly and I'm definitely not operating at my best`],
    ['00:35', `Identifying and breaking out of a cycle like this is probably the most important thing to focus on when you're in that kind of situation`],
    ['00:41', `And that's what I want to explore this piece. Again,`],
    ['00:43', `I think it's really important for me to repeat the fact that I know there are people out there`],
    ['00:48', `that have suffered way more than I have or ever will honestly considering the the`],
    ['00:53', `privileges that I have at my disposal`],
    ['00:55', `Overall, I've had a really good life`],
    ['00:56', `that being said`],
    ['00:57', `I think it's very very easy for all of us to fall into negative traps, destructive habits, toxic interactions, that kind of thing.`],
    ['01:04', `I remember arriving at a bus station in Argentina a little over two years ago and`],
    ['01:09', `calling my mom she was in another continent at the time and`],
    ['01:13', `We didn't even speak during that phone call. I just cried that was all that would come out`],
    ['01:19', `That was all that I was capable of in that moment`],
    ['01:21', `This is a really difficult experience to describe to somebody who has never gone through this before`],
    ['01:26', `It's kind of like you're falling and no matter what you do, you can't seem to grab on to something to stop.`],
    ['01:31', `I had really lost my footing, and I don't even want to think about what would have happened if I had continued on that trajectory.`],
    ['01:37', `I'm legitimately not looking for sympathy here. I`],
    ['01:40', `recognize that I'm a really sensitive person sometimes too sensitive and`],
    ['01:44', `This was a very important experience for me to have you know, for me to grow and to toughen up a little bit`],
    ['01:50', `And so in part 3 if my going essential this series I want to talk about what I've learned in breaking negative cycles`],
    ['01:57', `I`],
    ['02:02', `Know that I keep prefacing everything that I'm saying here and this is the last time I'm going to do that`],
    ['02:07', `But it's important for me to repeat that. This is 100% anecdotal`],
    ['02:11', `I'm not a psychologist, and this isn't even close to a replacement for professional help.`],
    ['02:15', `Please treat this for what this is which is just a video on the internet`],
    ['02:19', `Also, if you think that you're going through something that is potentially life-threatening`],
    ['02:22', `Please seek help do it for yourself and do it for the people that you love`],
    ['02:26', `Okay, so here are the things that helped me get better. One, change in environment`],
    ['02:31', `My definition for environment comes in two parts internal and external`],
    ['02:35', `external environment is your physical space as well as people that you interact with and the things that you expose yourself to like experiences`],
    ['02:43', `an Internal environment is your mentality and your thoughts the things that are going on in your head now`],
    ['02:49', `I had a problem with both`],
    ['02:50', `I had spent a time living in a place where I felt disliked and judged and just not free to express myself safely`],
    ['02:57', `However, my mindset was terrible as well. I was placing way too much importance in the opinions and words of others`],
    ['03:04', `I was painfully dependent on external validation. I'm still working on that in a way`],
    ['03:09', `I was acting like a little kid and that was completely my own fault and responsibility`],
    ['03:12', `I take full ownership for the fact that I let things get as unhealthy as they did`],
    ['03:16', `I needed to stop acting like a victim and letting that mindset ruin my life when environment was the problem either`],
    ['03:23', `Externally or internally I found that change can be extremely beneficial`],
    ['03:28', `So in a physical sense that can mean travelling to a new city or a new country`],
    ['03:32', `But it doesn't have to be that, you know, not everybody has access to that kind of thing. It can be as simple as`],
    ['03:37', `spending time in nature or spending time with different people`],
    ['03:40', `You know making new friends and on an internal level that can be changing the kind of content that you're consuming. As an example,`],
    ['03:46', `obviously`],
    ['03:47', `It's super important to be an informed citizen and to vote right but that doesn't mean you have to be plugged in to the negative`],
    ['03:53', `and sensationalized news cycle 24/7 it can be changing the accounts that you follow on social media or`],
    ['03:59', `adopting digital minimalism and reducing your exposure to social media in general anything that takes you out of your bubble and`],
    ['04:06', `Increases your perspective. This is super valuable because in my experience when I was in a bad place`],
    ['04:12', `I knew that something wasn't right`],
    ['04:14', `I just didn't know what to do about it in most cases`],
    ['04:17', `Exposure to new things can potentially provide you access to the answers that you're looking for. Two, learn a new skill`],
    ['04:24', `I think that adversity is incredible for growing and expanding as a person but`],
    ['04:29', `at some level, I think that is only possible once you've given yourself the chance to get back up on your feet. Now,`],
    ['04:35', `I've spoken about this before`],
    ['04:37', `learning new things has helped me get out of dark places in February of 2017. I returned to the US and`],
    ['04:44', `Realized that in a year and a half. I'd learned very little about the technical side of filmmaking`],
    ['04:48', `I was looking at my videos and not feeling like proud or excited about what I had done. Something kept pulling me back towards storytelling`],
    ['04:57', `And so I went it`],
    ['04:58', `I'm just gonna throw everything I've got at this. You can check out my video on how I learned things online if you're curious about`],
    ['05:04', `how I did that. This was extremely therapeutic for me and I'll tell you why I had gone a long time without any wings`],
    ['05:11', `so my self-esteem was at an all-time low and I was finally`],
    ['05:15', `learning a valuable skill. People could now use my services, you know`],
    ['05:20', `I could contribute something to the world and that changed everything for me.`],
    ['05:24', `I'm not sure what this dance move is exactly but it doesn't look this good at normal speed`],
    ['05:28', `I assure you this is more of a visual representation of how I felt. There's a shift that takes place`],
    ['05:34', `I think when you take things into your own hands, you're no longer an employee in your own life`],
    ['05:39', `You know`],
    ['05:39', `You're responsible for your own decisions.`],
    ['05:41', `Getting good at something can bring back some of that momentum that I mean at least in my case I had lost and`],
    ['05:47', `It can also become a way to express yourself. Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychologist and a brilliant man.`],
    ['05:53', `I think his message speaks to men in particular but it applies to anybody. He has spoken at length about the importance of`],
    ['06:01', `responsibility and having a purpose`],
    ['06:03', `He said, "The higher degree of responsibility that you agree voluntarily to try to bear, the richer your life will be." Three, do something difficult.`],
    ['06:11', `Okay,`],
    ['06:12', `So now you have a skill, right? Or maybe not even, maybe you're just starting out with something.`],
    ['06:16', `Once you've given yourself the chance to get back up on your feet,`],
    ['06:18', `Go and do something difficult without fail all the things that I'm most proud of in life`],
    ['06:23', `have been the hardest things that I've taken on. I'm not a very funny person`],
    ['06:27', `naturally, you know, I'm not witty. I think people that get to know me in person would will know what I'm talking about`],
    ['06:32', `I'm just not quick in that way. So I've made myself do improv in stand-up comedy. I suck at it. Okay`],
    ['06:39', `It's a total cringe fest, but that's not what matters. What I've gained from`],
    ['06:43', `those experiences was way more than that, which was confidence.`],
    ['06:45', `It has grown as I push myself even in little ways, but please don't take me as inspiration. Okay?`],
    ['06:52', `I'm not that remarkable. In fact, I'm not remarkable at all.`],
    ['06:55', `There are way better stories out there of people that have come from abject poverty or other`],
    ['06:59', `incredibly terrible odds and have been successful in their mission, if they could do it,`],
    ['07:04', `you definitely can. So, that covers the three main points that I wanted to talk about in this video. Take it or leave it`],
    ['07:10', `I hope that this was helpful. But once again, I can only draw from my own experiences`],
    ['07:14', `So if you've had a different experience or a different viewpoint on things`],
    ['07:18', `Please feel free to share it in the comments down below`],
    ['07:20', `and if you'd like to see more of this kind of content`],
    ['07:23', `Please consider sticking around and you can do that by subscribing to my channel`],
    ['07:27', `Following me on Instagram or signing up to my newsletter different perks or all three of those things`],
    ['07:33', `So giving you options. Alright. Thank you for watching, and I'll see you soon`]
