    ['00:00', `I've always had a lot of dreams, interests, passions—whatever you wish to call it. Probably`],
    ['00:06', `too many for my own good. One of my very first ones was… acting.`],
    ['00:12', `I wanted to play characters that would move people, the way I had been moved.`],
    ['00:19', `I dreamt of one day seeing my face on the big screen.`],
    ['00:24', `I would go on audition after audition. Study script after script.`],
    ['00:29', `Send in self-tape after self-tape. And I did get a few small jobs.`],
    ['00:35', `But more than anything, I got no's. No, after no, after no, after no.`],
    ['00:42', `And, mind you, in acting, it's often times not even a no, it's just complete silence`],
    ['00:49', `until you start to figure out that enough time has passed so they must've moved on`],
    ['00:54', `without you. I got a few maybe's, but those also eventually`],
    ['00:58', `turned into, well, silence, usually. It was a pretty suck-y feeling.`],
    ['01:04', `I would think I wasn't pretty enough, not smart enough, not charming enough, not interesting`],
    ['01:11', `enough. Just not enough. And so eventually, I had had enough.`],
    ['01:17', `But unless you crawl into a boll in a cave somewhere and hide from life—abandoning`],
    ['01:23', `one dream won't free you from rejection. Life has millions of ways of saying no.`],
    ['01:29', `Whether it's you pitching an idea to an investor or asking someone out on a date,`],
    ['01:34', `or if it's J K Rowling being rejected by 12 publishers, or Walt Disney being fired`],
    ['01:41', `by a newspaper editor because he lacked imagination and had no good ideas…`],
    ['01:46', `It happens to all of us. We chase, kiss and love. We ask, share, tell`],
    ['01:53', `and try, all in the risks of getting hurt. And sometimes, we do get really hurt.`],
    ['02:00', `So, why do we keep doing it? Why do we keep putting ourselves in situations, knowing that`],
    ['02:06', `we might get rejected, knowing that that rejection might haunt us?`],
    ['02:12', `Well, because, what the hell is the alternative? The alternative is nothing.`],
    ['02:18', `Nothing will happen. Any goal, ambition, wish, aim or dream you`],
    ['02:24', `have will all go to waste. Like a dead fish flowing along the stream—because`],
    ['02:30', `a life that's held back by fear isn't living, it's mealy existing—and the thought`],
    ['02:36', `of that should scare you more than any risk of rejection ever could.`],
    ['02:41', `Sylvia Plath once said “I love my rejection slips. They show me I try”.`],
    ['02:47', `So, whenever I think back on the times when I've been rejected, whether that be socially,`],
    ['02:54', `romantically, professionally, any -y—I remind myself that I tried.`],
    ['03:01', `I recognize that every risk that I've ever taken has been me pushing my limits, it's`],
    ['03:07', `been me aiming high, it's been me stepping out of my comfort zone.`],
    ['03:12', `I could've avoided a lot of rejection by not pushing myself, by aiming low, by playing`],
    ['03:18', `it safe and by staying in my comfort zone. And perhaps it would've saved me some heartache.`],
    ['03:23', `But in exchange for that, I would have to give all the lessons, all the growth, all`],
    ['03:29', `the memories, all the people and all the stories that I've collected along the way.`],
    ['03:34', `That's not an exchange that I'd ever be willing to make.`],
    ['03:38', `Now, rejection is still tough and I'm not trying to romanticize it.`],
    ['03:44', `But I'm learning to accept the fact that not everything in life is a match.`],
    ['03:49', `I mean, can you imagine a world where all human beings are suited for each other and`],
    ['03:55', `where everything just fits perfectly for everyone? Can you imagine a life where we wouldn't`],
    ['04:00', `need to search and explore, where all the answers were right in front of us all the`],
    ['04:05', `time? Where everything we ever desired just fell right into our laps?`],
    ['04:11', `Isn't the search what keeps life interesting? The search for answers, the search for what's`],
    ['04:17', `right for us, love and the search for meaning? Not everything you desire will be meant for`],
    ['04:25', `you, nor will you be meant for everything you desire.`],
    ['04:30', `The job you didn't get, the idea that got turned down, the friend that stopped reaching`],
    ['04:36', `out, the person who left you heartbroken—we tend to see it as them not wanting us, like`],
    ['04:43', `we weren't good enough for them. And perhaps that's true.`],
    ['04:48', `But more often than we know, that rejection saved us from something. That rejection redirected`],
    ['04:54', `us to some place better, perhaps a place we haven't reached yet. It might be timing,`],
    ['05:00', `it might be skill, it might be for a reason we haven't found yet.`],
    ['05:04', `I'm learning to trust that any rejection I face is the best thing that could happen`],
    ['05:10', `to me, because it's forced me to stop and reflect on myself, and that's where learning`],
    ['05:16', `happens; that's where growth happens. So, as far as my acting journey goes.`],
    ['05:21', `Of course, it was painful. Of course, I still wonder what if sometimes.`],
    ['05:28', `But in trusting that rejection was necessary for me in order to grow; and in learning the`],
    ['05:33', `value of hard work; and in accepting that no's are part of the process; and in being`],
    ['05:40', `grateful for every single opportunity that I've ever gotten, regardless of the outcome;`],
    ['05:46', `I get to live with less regrets. And for that reason; I would take that pain`],
    ['05:52', `any day. Because, again, what the hell is the alternative?`],
