    ['00:00', `Last year I had developed a bad habit of snacking`],
    ['00:02', `I had lost all self-control in the face of a free donut or plate of cookies. And I made justifications for my actions`],
    ['00:09', `Excuses like: 'well, I did go to the gym today.' 'Overall I eat pretty healthy'`],
    ['00:13', `'It's not like I do this every day.'... Until I started to do it every day.`],
    ['00:17', `I knew something had to change when even though I exercise often, I noticed I was developing early onset dad-gut.`],
    ['00:25', `So I decided to quit sugar for 30 days`],
    ['00:29', `Now most of us know that too much sugar is a bad thing`],
    ['00:33', `It's something that we've been taught ever since we were kids. And apart from simply putting a little bit of weight on your gut`],
    ['00:38', `There's a lot more serious problems that can come with eating too much sugar. It can damage your metabolism,`],
    ['00:44', `cause type 2 diabetes, increase the likelihood that you'll get liver or kidney damage, causes inflammation of the skin`],
    ['00:51', `Joint pain, tooth decay and even problems maintaining an erection`],
    ['00:55', `So yeah, there's there's even that as well. So that's probably the main reason- no,`],
    ['01:00', `It's not the main reason, get that out of your head`],
    ['01:02', `So on top of all that, on top of all of these bad things that it does to your body`],
    ['01:08', `it's also very`],
    ['01:10', `Addictive. So I know the first thing that I want to do right now is go through my entire`],
    ['01:14', `apartment, and find all of the things that have added sugar, and get them out of my apartment. So let's do that now.`],
    ['01:22', `I knew it was consuming a decent amount of sugar,`],
    ['01:25', `But without reading the labels and digging into weekly snacks and meals, I wouldn't know for sure`],
    ['01:29', `There were of course some no-brainers. Ice cream is loaded,`],
    ['01:34', `Chocolate snacks are packed,`],
    ['01:36', `My once a month energy drink. But I was also surprised to find a lot of sugar in my protein bars,`],
    ['01:42', `My breakfast cereal is basically a dessert. Even the bread I was buying had 5 grams / slice`],
    ['01:48', `If you're like me and you have very little self-control`],
    ['01:51', `The only thing you can do to regain control is to completely change your environment`],
    ['01:55', `It's impossible to eat snacks that you refuse to purchase and bring into your home in the first place`],
    ['01:59', `So all this stuff needs to go`],
    ['02:02', `The cravings were the worst for the first couple days, but even a week in I was struggling late at night`],
    ['02:08', `All right, so I'm seven days into this no sugar challenge and this is probably the toughest night so far about 45 minutes ago`],
    ['02:15', `I had a bit of a sugar craving and`],
    ['02:18', `Instinctively I went to my snack cabinet and I'll show you guys what I found`],
    ['02:23', `That's it`],
    ['02:25', `Organic rice cake`],
    ['02:27', `Nothing, nothing sweet there`],
    ['02:31', `Before I started this challenge I did a little bit of research, but I still had a lot of questions about sugar`],
    ['02:36', `What kind of sugar should we be avoiding? And how much is too much?`],
    ['02:39', `So I asked my friend Becca Shern to help clear some things up for me. She's a registered dietician and founder of Minimal Wellness`],
    ['02:45', `I'm hoping you can help me kind of break down when people decide to get sugar out of the diet,`],
    ['02:52', `what does that look usually look like, what kind of sugars are people usually trying to cut out? - Most people, when they're trying to cut`],
    ['02:58', `out sugar, they're talking about added sugar. So`],
    ['03:01', `sugar that gets added to a processed food.`],
    ['03:06', `That's like table sugar, or honey, or high fructose corn syrup "My king, this corn syrup was just delivered"`],
    ['03:14', `Generally, it's recommended that you're somewhere, - but under ideally - 5 % of your calories from added sugar.`],
    ['03:19', `So for a 2000 calorie diet, that's 25 grams of added sugar`],
    ['03:25', `And it turns out that added sugar can add up quick`],
    ['03:28', `I noticed the high levels in some of my daily snacks and the occasional foods`],
    ['03:33', `I might get served on an airplane. While my old instinct was to throw food in my mouth,`],
    ['03:38', `my new instinct was to check the back of the package, and then throw my food at Natalie`],
    ['03:45', `You're not aiming for 25 grams of sugar every day it's like`],
    ['03:51', `over the course of a week, over the course of a month. Like some days are really low,`],
    ['03:56', `some days are quite high.`],
    ['03:57', `So that is where you can get the flexibility to have dessert on a special occasion`],
    ['04:03', `And I think that, that's where, as a culture, we've really like got off track, as we no longer have sugar`],
    ['04:11', `relegated to`],
    ['04:13', `Desserts or special occasions, right? It's like in everything, because we eat so much processed food`],
    ['04:19', `Yeah, and it was surprising even for me`],
    ['04:22', `Like I had watched Fed Up, and these documentaries, and I've read a lot of blog posts about how much sugar is in everything`],
    ['04:28', `I knew it, but then I was still surprised by certain things`],
    ['04:31', `Like my granola bar was like 30 grams of sugar and I'm like, that's why I taste so good!`],
    ['04:37', `And it's hard`],
    ['04:39', `I think it takes a lot, really like looking at everything you you're purchasing, and really understanding that if it tastes too good to be true,`],
    ['04:46', `it's probably...`],
    ['04:48', `Yeah. Yeah, I mean there's a reason why food manufacturers put a lot of added sugar in things. It tastes good,`],
    ['04:55', `it makes you want to buy it again. This is really straightforward.`],
    ['04:59', `The problem is, it's`],
    ['05:01', `terrible for us.`],
    ['05:03', `Becca thought my 30-day`],
    ['05:04', `no-sugar challenge was a good step to understanding how my body personally responds to sugar. But also stressed the importance of maintaining a healthy`],
    ['05:12', `And balanced diet. If I'm being honest, my diet isn't always balanced and it can sometimes look a bit primitive`],
    ['05:19', `All right, so tonight's dinner can really only be described as a bowl of food.`],
    ['05:25', `Let me show you guys what we're working with here. We've got your rice your chicken and your daily recommended`],
    ['05:33', `bacon. I should be eating more veggies. I just realize that right now.`],
    ['05:37', `I'm gonna start doing that. Soon`],
    ['05:40', `but first, bacon`],
    ['05:41', `I must not have had a terrible sugar addiction, because I didn't experience any headaches, or major`],
    ['05:47', `discomfort, outside of nightly cravings. To combat these cravings`],
    ['05:50', `I made some tea as a replacement. This really helped to keep my mind`],
    ['05:54', `distracted. My biggest fear and motivation to go on this 30-day challenge, is because I know how small changes make a big difference.`],
    ['06:01', `Now normally when I talk about small changes, it relates to positive change, but it also works in the opposite direction`],
    ['06:07', `Small bad habits, like snacking on junk food can build up and compound to something much worse.`],
    ['06:13', `'What are you looking at?"`],
    ['06:15', `You make those early excuses and justifications`],
    ['06:18', `But eventually you don't need to make them anymore, because the bad habit sticks, and you're running on autopilot.`],
    ['06:23', `So I'm thankful that I got out in front of it, before things got any worse.`],
    ['06:27', `In the past, I had relied on smoothies to get most of my vitamins, but as a part of this challenge,`],
    ['06:33', `I also wanted to cut back on fruit. While they do include vitamins, nutrients and fibers that are good for you,`],
    ['06:38', `I wanted to force myself to eat more greens.`],
    ['06:42', `After the first 10 days, I started to prepare and eat healthier meals for dinner. I'd have fish with brown rice and sauteed kale`],
    ['06:48', `Salads became my go-to meal because they were convenient and easy to prepare`],
    ['06:53', `We have curry cod with some brown rice and sauteed`],
    ['06:59', `kale. And the kale, I actually sauteed it with some chicken broth with which I'm also gonna be drinking here`],
    ['07:05', `This is like a bachelor meal.`],
    ['07:06', `Natalie is definitely much better around the kitchen than I am.`],
    ['07:09', `I primarily eat for sustenance, while she cooks and eats for the love of the food.`],
    ['07:15', `'That is extremely sweet'`],
    ['07:18', `'Look at it: double the sauce,`],
    ['07:22', `I got`],
    ['07:23', `no sauce.' I found workarounds and substitutes for all meals that included sugar. Instead of fig jam sauce`],
    ['07:30', `I used mustard, instead of vinegar`],
    ['07:32', `I used olive oil and a healthy squeeze of lemon, topped with some salt and pepper.`],
    ['07:36', `Three weeks in, and I noticed that my energy levels became more stable.`],
    ['07:40', `No longer did I have huge swings of high to low energy throughout the day,`],
    ['07:45', `especially as I tried to balance my diet out with protein, carbs, greens,`],
    ['07:51', `and a little bit less bacon.`],
    ['07:53', `So what you're experiencing there is, is energy levels, but it's blood sugar fluctuations`],
    ['07:58', `So when you have lots of added sugar in your diet,`],
    ['08:04', `you can get really big fluctuations in your blood sugar levels, which make you feel like you've got a lot of energy and then`],
    ['08:11', `Holy crap, you're crashing, and you have no energy. And then, what you typically do when you feel like you have no energy`],
    ['08:18', `especially if you're not paying attention, is to gravitate towards something that will give you quick energy, which`],
    ['08:24', `sugar.`],
    ['08:26', `So you go back up,`],
    ['08:28', `you feel good for a little while, and then you crash again. In addition to more stable energy levels,`],
    ['08:33', `I also noticed a significant reduction of my dad-gut. It didn't disappear, but the tide had turned.`],
    ['08:40', `Alright, so the 30 day challenge is done, and I feel pretty good, I feel pretty good`],
    ['08:45', `There were a few things that I changed over the past 30 days.`],
    ['08:48', `I did start going to the gym more, and now that I'm not traveling as much,`],
    ['08:52', `I also reduced my carbs partly because of the reduction in added sugar and`],
    ['08:58', `It's hard to pinpoint the exact percentage`],
    ['09:01', `of benefit that I received from getting rid of sugar. To steal a phrase from Dan Harris, I'd say maybe I was 10%`],
    ['09:09', `healthier. It definitely made a huge difference in my energy levels and in how I felt every day, and it was definitely nice to curb`],
    ['09:15', `those cravings, because, who knows how bad it could have gotten, if I just kept snacking and kept going.`],
    ['09:20', `My dad-gut could have potentially turned into a grandpa-gut, which would have been really scary. But going forward. I love sweets,`],
    ['09:27', `I love dessert, big fan, and I don't want to just get rid of it`],
    ['09:31', `completely, because I think in this life we need to actually enjoy things,`],
    ['09:34', `but I want to bring it back in moderation. So starting next month.`],
    ['09:38', `I'm going to experiment with a once a week`],
    ['09:41', `cheat meal`],
    ['09:42', `and that starts tomorrow.`],
    ['09:47', `If you'd like to get exclusive videos on habit-change, filmmaking, business and lifestyle design go to patreon.com/mattdavella`],
    ['09:55', `Get access to all my extended interviews, like my conversation with Becca Shern.`],
