    ['00:00', `If you had to choose right now, how long would you want to live?`],
    ['00:05', `80 years? 90?`],
    ['00:07', `120?`],
    ['00:09', `Longer?`],
    ['00:10', `And do you think you'll change your mind once you reach that age?`],
    ['00:15', `Fifty thousand years ago most humans died very young.`],
    ['00:19', `As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves, this got better and better.`],
    ['00:24', `Today, humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before.`],
    ['00:29', `But this has an unforeseen consequence.`],
    ['00:32', `We spend an ever-increasing part of our lives being sick and in need of care.`],
    ['00:37', `Most of us will die in a hospital bed, which is depressing enough by itself.`],
    ['00:42', `But we also have to witness the same happening to our loved ones.`],
    ['00:45', `Except, maybe we can stop this forever.`],
    ['00:49', `The most effective way to treat a disease is to prevent it.`],
    ['00:53', `It saves many more lives if you stop a million people from smoking, than coming up with better chemotherapies.`],
    ['01:00', `So why not put a halt to the cause of all disease: the process of aging.`],
    ['01:05', `In a nutshell, aging is caused by physics, and not biology.`],
    ['01:10', `Think of cars. Parts wear down from rubbing and grinding. Metal rusts. Filters get plugged. Rubber cracks.`],
    ['01:19', `Our bodies are worn down by trillions of tiny physical processes.`],
    ['01:23', `Oxygen, radiation from the sun, our metabolism.`],
    ['01:28', `Our bodies have many mechanisms to repair this damage,`],
    ['01:31', `but over time they become less effective.`],
    ['01:33', `So our bones and muscles weaken. Our skin wrinkles. Our immune system gets weaker.`],
    ['01:39', `We lose our memory and our senses diminish.`],
    ['01:42', `There's no such thing as dying of old age. We all die because one of our important parts breaks.`],
    ['01:48', `The older we get, the more damaged and fragile we become until one or multiple diseases take over and kill us.`],
    ['01:57', `Unnoticed by most of us, longevity research has made some unprecedented advances in the last few years.`],
    ['02:02', `For the first time, we're starting to understand the mechanisms behind aging and how to manipulate them.`],
    ['02:09', `Aging is neither mystical nor inevitable, and we might be able to stop or delay it during your lifetime.`],
    ['02:15', `We'll discuss the science behind it and how scientists are trying to stop it in another video.`],
    ['02:21', `But first, if we could, should we end aging? Is this a good idea?`],
    ['02:28', `The end of aging or life extension makes many people uncomfortable.`],
    ['02:32', `We're born, are young, become older, and then we die.`],
    ['02:36', `This has been the natural order for literally all of human history, and getting old is a good thing, right?`],
    ['02:43', `We celebrate the idea of living long enough to experience old age. We even call them the golden years.`],
    ['02:49', `But the reality is that everybody wants to become old, but nobody wants to be old.`],
    ['02:55', `Think of the Greek myth of Tithonus for example.`],
    ['02:58', `Tithonus was the lover of the goddess Eos and probably an amazing dude,`],
    ['03:02', `because she begged Zeus to grant him immortality, so they could spend eternity together.`],
    ['03:07', `But she forgot to specifically ask for eternal youth.`],
    ['03:11', `Tithonus was granted eternal life, but he kept aging, unable to die.`],
    ['03:16', `After a few hundred years, he was reduced to the size of a grape, babbling on senselessly forever.`],
    ['03:23', `Thousands of years ago, humans already feared never-ending old age.`],
    ['03:27', `But ending aging does not mean getting weaker and weaker. If you become too old, it's too late.`],
    ['03:33', `A 90 year old who stopped aging would die anyway after a few years.`],
    ['03:37', `Too much damage has been done to his internal machinery. There are already too many surfaces for disease to attack.`],
    ['03:44', `Instead, the concept of life extension promises to end diseases, and with them, the end of a fixed maximum age.`],
    ['03:51', `We don't know how much we could prolong our lives.`],
    ['03:53', `We might make every human healthy to the currently accepted maximum age of around 120,`],
    ['03:59', `or we might stop biological aging and disease indefinitely.`],
    ['04:03', `Nobody knows at this point what's possible.`],
    ['04:06', `Okay, but even if we could achieve that, should we?`],
    ['04:10', `Well, life extension is really just another phrase for medicine.`],
    ['04:14', `All the doctors are doing is trying to prolong life, and minimize suffering.`],
    ['04:18', `The vast majority of healthcare resources are spent on the consequences of aging.`],
    ['04:23', `Nearly half of your lifetime healthcare costs will be spent during your senior years, and another third during middle age.`],
    ['04:30', `We are actually already trying to prolong life with our current medicine. We're just doing it very inefficiently.`],
    ['04:37', `Trying to stop aging from happening is not less natural than transplanting a heart,`],
    ['04:41', `treating cancer with chemotherapy, using antibiotics or vaccines.`],
    ['04:46', `Nothing humans do nowadays is purely natural anymore, and we enjoy the highest standard of living ever as a consequence of that.`],
    ['04:53', `What we're doing right now is waiting until it's too late and the machine is failing.`],
    ['04:58', `And then we use the vast majority of our resources trying to fix it as well as we can, while it breaks down even further.`],
    ['05:05', `But life extension still feels hubristic.`],
    ['05:08', `Most people assume that they will want to die once they reach a certain age, and this might still be true.`],
    ['05:14', `The idea of avoiding death entirely is off-putting for many.`],
    ['05:18', `The end of biological aging would not be in the end of death in any way.`],
    ['05:23', `It's more like a summer evening when you were a kid, and your mom called you inside.`],
    ['05:28', `You just wanted to keep playing, have a little more fun during sunset before you went to sleep.`],
    ['05:33', `It's not about playing outside forever, just a little longer, until we feel tired.`],
    ['05:38', `If you imagine a world without disease where you and your loved ones could live in good health for another 100 or 200 years, how would this change us?`],
    ['05:47', `Would we take better care of our planet if we knew we would be around longer?`],
    ['05:51', `If we could work for 150 years, how much time would we spend figuring out what we're good at? How much more time would we spend learning?`],
    ['05:59', `Would the intense feeling of pressure and stress many of us are feeling right now, go away or get worse?`],
    ['06:07', `So asking again, if you could choose how long to live right now, in good health and with your friends and family, what's your personal answer?`],
    ['06:16', `What would you like your future to look like?`],
    ['06:20', `CGP Grey: But maybe you're still unconvinced.`],
    ['06:22', `Some nagging feeling remains. That is the Reaper whispering into your brain.`],
    ['06:28', `Watch my video to hear what he says, and why you shouldn't listen.`],
    ['06:33', `Your eternal future may depend on it.`],
    ['06:38', `Kurzgesagt: Go watch the other part over at CGP Grey's channel, and if you're not already subscribed, subscribe.`]
