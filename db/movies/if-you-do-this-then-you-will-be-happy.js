    ['00:00', `It is a very gray and rainy day outside,`],
    ['00:03', `so having a cup of tea is incredibly comforting.`],
    ['00:05', `And this is our first 'Tea-time Tuesday' segment in the new studio.`],
    ['00:14', `Finding happiness is something I was hoping we could chat about today`],
    ['00:18', `and I know that it's an incredibly difficult topic to cover because every person is so individual`],
    ['00:23', `when it comes to how they feel happy and what makes them happy.`],
    ['00:26', `And, the topic of happiness: I feel like it's been tackled by philosophers since the dawn of man`],
    ['00:31', `and there seems to be kind of no trivial answer when we are looking at how people can become more happy.`],
    ['00:37', `But when we look at something like social media or commercials, they make it seem like it's not even a question at all.`],
    ['00:43', `They give us the impression that, you know, if you buy a certain thing or if you look a certain way,`],
    ['00:47', `then you'll become happy.`],
    ['00:49', `They make it seem like happiness is conditional.`],
    ['00:51', `If you do this, then you'll be happy.`],
    ['00:57', `By now I think we've all learned, from one source or another, that social media is heavily curated.`],
    ['01:02', `We selectively, and very carefully, choose what we share with the world.`],
    ['01:06', `The content that I share is very much included in all of that.`],
    ['01:09', `So for example, I share with you meals that I authentically eat at home.`],
    ['01:12', `But I plate it in a way that I wouldn't normally do if I was eating it alone at home. Cause I grab some`],
    ['01:18', `artsy-looking bowls. I place it on a backdrop with some accent pieces that color complement the food.`],
    ['01:23', `I make things look a little bit messy.`],
    ['01:25', `I add garnishes to make it look really pretty.`],
    ['01:27', `And, I do all of that because it's an art form for me,`],
    ['01:30', `but I think it gives people the impression that, that's what my food looks like all the time. But it's not!`],
    ['01:36', `It's the whole expectation vs reality bit.`],
    ['01:39', `And the same thing happens when we are scrolling through social media`],
    ['01:42', `and we see these people who look like they're living exceptionally happy lives.`],
    ['01:46', `And we start to think to ourselves, "Maybe if I do what they're doing,`],
    ['01:49', `then I'll also be happy.`],
    ['01:51', `Maybe if I travel more, then I'll be happy.`],
    ['01:54', `If I buy that outfit,`],
    ['01:55', `that makeup, that jewelry, then I'll be happy."`],
    ['01:59', `"Maybe I don't have time for that, because I'm studying, but if and when I graduate then I'll be happy."`],
    ['02:04', `It's this game we're constantly playing and it's a game we're never winning.`],
    ['02:09', `And it's the If... then game. "If I get fit, then I'll be happy."`],
    ['02:13', `"If I find a loving and supportive partner, then I'll be happy."`],
    ['02:17', `If... then. If... then. If... then.`],
    ['02:20', `And it's a very toxic way of thinking.`],
    ['02:23', `And, I think it's toxic for a couple of reasons.`],
    ['02:25', `For one: it makes us feel like happiness is something that only comes later and as a result of something.`],
    ['02:31', `But, that is definitely not the case!`],
    ['02:32', `Happiness is something we can all tap into at any moment.`],
    ['02:36', `And the second reason it's toxic:`],
    ['02:38', `let's say we do that thing; we go travel,`],
    ['02:41', `we graduate, we buy that jewelry, we get fit, we have that partner.`],
    ['02:45', `Then what?`],
    ['02:47', `Cause from my experience, it's always something else.`],
    ['02:49', `The bar keeps getting set higher and higher, and happiness seems to be this thing that is forever out of reach.`],
    ['02:54', `And, that's how a lot of us can end up feeling like we're stuck in a rut.`],
    ['02:58', `So what can we do about it?`],
    ['03:00', `I think there are three things we can do.`],
    ['03:02', `For one: catch that thinking dead in its tracks. If you notice yourself doing the If... then thinking,`],
    ['03:07', `remind yourself that it's important to have aspirations and dreams and desires,`],
    ['03:12', `but achieving those things alone will not make you happy.`],
    ['03:15', `Other things can also bring about happiness!`],
    ['03:18', `Number two: in that exact moment when you notice yourself doing the If... then thinking`],
    ['03:22', `try to shift your mindset and, one way to do that is to just stop, look around you, and start saying "thank you."`],
    ['03:28', `"thank you, thank you, thank you."`],
    ['03:31', `for everything thats around you.`],
    ['03:33', `Maybe you live in a certain home,`],
    ['03:35', `or you're surrounded by certain people, you live in a certain country.`],
    ['03:38', `There is things to be thankful for.`],
    ['03:41', `I think that when we do the If... then thinking, we are focusing on the things that we lack.`],
    ['03:45', `But when we say "thank you," we are grateful for the things that we have.`],
    ['03:48', `And, so you might want to travel really badly, but we live in a country where a lot of people come to as tourists.`],
    ['03:54', `Is there a way that maybe you can be a tourist in your own country?`],
    ['03:57', `It's just about shifting the mindset a little bit.`],
    ['04:00', `We might not have graduated yet, but we have the ability to get an education.`],
    ['04:04', `We have the ability to advance our knowledge.`],
    ['04:06', `We might not have a partner, but maybe we have supportive friends or family.`],
    ['04:11', `The point of this is to focus on the things that we have instead of the things that we lack.`],
    ['04:15', `And number three:`],
    ['04:16', `I think it's really important to also mention, that it's okay to not be in the state of happiness all the time,`],
    ['04:23', `contrary to what social media makes you believe.`],
    ['04:26', `That's just being human! And, I think that's sometimes the flaw of some of the self-improvement movement.`],
    ['04:33', `It makes us feel like if we're not stronger, happier, faster, better versions of our former selves then we've failed in some way.`],
    ['04:40', `We feel guilty for feeling the ups and downs of life, but that's just characteristic to being human.`],
    ['04:46', `We need the ups and downs and hardships to learn and grow.`],
    ['04:49', `And those down moments help us appreciate the up moments so much more!`],
    ['04:53', `So if I can summarize: happiness is this very difficult and complex topic to explore but it's the state of emotion that we are all constantly striving to achieve.`],
    ['05:03', `And, I think one important way that we can do that is to be grateful for the things that we have instead of focusing on the things that we lack.`],
    ['05:11', `So trying to minimize that if... then thinking whenever we can,`],
    ['05:14', `and to realize that it's only human to feel down sometimes`],
    ['05:18', `and to not, kind of feel, guilty for feeling that way.`],
    ['05:22', `And, also, before I sign off, there is one more thing`],
    ['05:24', `I've been wanting to mention for a while now.`],
    ['05:59', `I think that's it for today.`],
    ['06:00', `Thanks a lot for enjoying this cup of tea with me! I hope you guys have an awesome week ahead.`],
    ['06:05', `We'll see you in the next video!!!`]
