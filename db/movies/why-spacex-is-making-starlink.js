    ['00:05', `that teaches you to think like an engineer.`],
    ['00:07', `On the 24th of May, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket filled with 60 satellites into space.`],
    ['00:14', `This marked the beginning of their ambitious new project called “Starlink” which aims`],
    ['00:18', `to provide high quality broadband internet to the most isolated parts of the planet,`],
    ['00:23', `while also providing low latency connectivity to already well connected cities.`],
    ['00:28', `[1] SpaceX aim to make their broadband as accessible as possible, claiming that anyone`],
    ['00:33', `will be able to connect to their network if they buy the pizza box-sized antenna which`],
    ['00:38', `SpaceX is developing themselves.`],
    ['00:41', `This launch of 60 satellites, was just the first of many.`],
    ['00:45', `Spacex has 12,000 satellites [12] planned for launch over the next decade, dramatically`],
    ['00:50', `increasing the total amount of spacecraft around Earth’s orbit.`],
    ['00:54', `This will cost SpaceX billions of dollars, so they must have a good reason for doing`],
    ['00:58', `so.`],
    ['00:59', `Let’s see how this network will work, and how it will compete with existing internet`],
    ['01:04', `providers.`],
    ['01:05', `Back in 2015, Elon announced that SpaceX had began working on a communication satellite`],
    ['01:11', `network, stating that there is a significant unmet demand for low-cost global broadband`],
    ['01:16', `capabilities.`],
    ['01:18', `Around that time, SpaceX opened a new facility in Redmond, Washington to develop and manufacture`],
    ['01:23', `these new communication satellites.`],
    ['01:26', `The initial plan was to launch two prototype satellites into orbit by 2016 and have the`],
    ['01:31', `initial satellite consetllation up and running by 2020.`],
    ['01:35', `But the company struggled to develop a receiver that could be easily installed by the user`],
    ['01:39', `for a low cost, this delayed the program and the initial prototype satellites weren’t`],
    ['01:44', `launched until 2018.`],
    ['01:46', `After a successful launch of the two prototypes, Tintin-A and B, which allowed SpaceX to test`],
    ['01:52', `and refine their satellite design, SpaceX kept pretty quiet about what was next for`],
    ['01:57', `the Starlink project, until November 2018 when SpaceX received the approval from the`],
    ['02:01', `FCC to deploy 7,500 satellites into orbit, on top of the 4,400 that were already approved.`],
    ['02:10', `On May 24th, the first batch of production satellites were launched into orbit and people`],
    ['02:15', `around the world quickly started to spot the train of satellites moving across the night`],
    ['02:20', `sky.`],
    ['02:21', `This launch is a sign of things to come, while this initial group of satellites are not fully`],
    ['02:25', `functional [8], they will be used to test things like the earth communications systems`],
    ['02:30', `and the krypton thrusters which will be used to autonomously avoid debris and de-orbit`],
    ['02:35', `the spacecraft once it has reached the end of its lifecycle.`],
    ['02:38', `Let’s look at these functionalities first.`],
    ['02:41', `We have explored how ion thrusters work in the past, which you can watch for more detail,`],
    ['02:46', `but essentially they use electric potential to fire ions out of the spacecraft to provide`],
    ['02:51', `propulsion.`],
    ['02:52', `Xenon is ideally used, because it has a high atomic mass allowing it to provide more kick`],
    ['02:57', `per atom, while being inert and having a high storage density lending itself to long term`],
    ['03:03', `storage on a spacecraft.`],
    ['03:05', `However SpaceX opted for krypton, as xenon’s rarity makes it a far more expensive propellant.`],
    ['03:11', `[2] This ion thruster will initially be used to raise the starlink satellites from their`],
    ['03:15', `release orbits at 440 km to their final orbital height of 550 km[1].`],
    ['03:22', `They will also be used in conjunction with on board control momentum gyroscopes located`],
    ['03:28', `here, and the US Governments’ space debris collision prediction system to allow the satellites`],
    ['03:33', `to adjust their orbits to dodge collisions, which we have also spoken about in more detail`],
    ['03:38', `in a previous video.`],
    ['03:40', `When the satellites have reached the end of their service life they can then use the same`],
    ['03:44', `attitude controls and thrusters to de-orbit the satellite.`],
    ['03:47', `Space X have included all the necessary hardware to minimise space debris risk.`],
    ['03:53', `In their Federal Communications Commission approval application [3], they claim that`],
    ['03:57', `95% of the satellite will burn up on re-entry.`],
    ['04:01', `With only the ion thruster internal structure and silicon carbide components, standing a`],
    ['04:06', `chance of survival.`],
    ['04:07', `Those silicon carbide components are likely to survive, as they are essential materials`],
    ['04:12', `for the operation of lasers and thus have an extremely high melting point of 2,750°C.`],
    ['04:18', `[9]`],
    ['04:19', `Which brings us to our communications abilities, the primary function of the satellite.`],
    ['04:25', `Spacex have been tight lipped on many of the details of the satellite, but thanks to that`],
    ['04:29', `FCC filing [3] we know that the satellites will contain 5 1.5 kilogram silicon carbide`],
    ['04:35', `components, which indicates that each satellite will contain 5 individual lasers.`],
    ['04:40', `These lasers, like our fibre optic cables here on earth, will use light pulses to transmit`],
    ['04:46', `information between satellites.`],
    ['04:49', `Transmitting with light in space offers one massive advantage over transmitting with light`],
    ['04:53', `here on earth however.`],
    ['04:55', `The speed of light is not constant in every material, in fact, light travels 47% slower`],
    ['05:02', `in glass than in a vacuum.`],
    ['05:05', `This offers starlink one huge advantage that will likely be it’s primary money maker.`],
    ['05:10', `It provides the potential of lower latency information over long distance, in simpler`],
    ['05:15', `terms let’s imagine this as a race between data packets.`],
    ['05:19', `A user in London wants the new adjusted price of a stock on the NASDAQ from the New York`],
    ['05:25', `stock exchange.`],
    ['05:26', `If this information were use a typical route, let’s say through the AC-2 cable [RI-3],`],
    ['05:31', `which has a return journey of about 12,800 kilometres to make through our glass fibre`],
    ['05:36', `optic cable.`],
    ['05:37', `In a vacuum light travels at a speed of 299,792,458 meters per second [5].`],
    ['05:46', `The speed of travel in glass depends on the refractive index and the refractive index`],
    ['05:50', `depends on wavelength, but we will take the reduction as 1.47 times slower than the speed`],
    ['05:55', `of light in a vacuum [203940448 m/s].`],
    ['05:57', `[6] This means the data packet will take roughly 0.063 seconds to make the round trip, and`],
    ['06:03', `thus has a latency of 0.063 seconds, or 62.7 milliseconds.`],
    ['06:10', `With the additional steps that add to this latency like the conversion of light signals`],
    ['06:14', `to electrical signals on either end of the optical cable, traffic queues, and the transfer`],
    ['06:19', `to our final computer terminal, this total time comes out at about 76 milliseconds.`],
    ['06:25', `Figuring out the latency for Starlink is a lot more difficult, as we have no real world`],
    ['06:30', `measurements to go by, but we can make some educated guesses with the help of Mark Handley,`],
    ['06:35', `a communications professor in University College London.`],
    ['06:38', `[10]`],
    ['06:39', `The first source of latency for Starlink will be during the up and down link process, where`],
    ['06:44', `we need to transfer our information to and from earth.`],
    ['06:47', `We know this will be done with phase array antenna, which are radio antenna that can`],
    ['06:52', `control the direction of their transmission without moving parts, instead they use destructive`],
    ['06:57', `and constructive interference [7] to control the direction of the radio wave.`],
    ['07:02', `Each satellite has a cone beam with a 81 degree range of view.`],
    ['07:06', `With an orbit of 550 kilometres each satellite can cover a circular area with a radius of`],
    ['07:12', `500 kilometre.`],
    ['07:14', `At SpaceX’s originally planned orbit this coverage had a radius of 1060 kilometres.`],
    ['07:20', `Lowering the altitude of a satellite decreases the area it can cover, but also decreases`],
    ['07:25', `the latency.`],
    ['07:26', `This is particularly noticeable for typical communications satellites operating in geostationary`],
    ['07:32', `orbit at an altitude of about 36,000 kilometres.`],
    ['07:35', `The time it takes data to travel up to the satellite and back down travelling at the`],
    ['07:39', `speed of light is around 240 milliseconds [13] 369% slower than our subsea cable.`],
    ['07:47', `However, since Starlink is intending to operate at a much lower altitude, the up and down`],
    ['07:52', `link theoretical latency could be as low as 3.6 ms.`],
    ['07:57', `This is why SpaceX needs so many satellites in their constellation in order to provide`],
    ['08:01', `worldwide coverage.`],
    ['08:03', `Each individual starlink satellite has four phased array antenna located here, here, here`],
    ['08:09', `and here.`],
    ['08:10', `This directional beam was an essential part of SpaceX’s FCC approval application [3],`],
    ['08:15', `as thousands of satellites broadcasting undirected radio waves would cause significant amounts`],
    ['08:21', `of interference with other communication methods.`],
    ['08:24', `Once that data is received by one starlink satellite, it can begin to transmit that information`],
    ['08:29', `between satellites using lasers.`],
    ['08:32', `Each time we hop from satellites there will be a small delay as the laser light is converted`],
    ['08:36', `to an electric signal and back again, but it is too miniscule to consider.`],
    ['08:41', `Things get tricky here with using lasers, as we need to accurately hit the receiver`],
    ['08:45', `on neighbouring satellites to transmit that data.`],
    ['08:48', `Let’s look at SpaceX’s proposed constellation to see how this will work.`],
    ['08:52', `Space X’s first phase of 1584 satellites will occupy 24 orbital planes, with 66 satellites`],
    ['09:01', `in each plane inclined at 53 degrees.`],
    ['09:03', `That will look something like this.`],
    ['09:06', `Communication between neighbouring satellites in the same orbital plane is relatively simple,`],
    ['09:11', `as these satellites will remain in relatively stable positions in relation to each other.`],
    ['09:16', `This gives us a solid line of communication along a single orbital plane, but in many`],
    ['09:21', `cases a single orbital plane will not connect two locations, so we need to be able transfer`],
    ['09:28', `information between these planes too.`],
    ['09:31', `This requires precise tracking, as the satellites travelling in neighbouring orbital planes`],
    ['09:36', `are travelling incredibly quickly and will come in and out of view.`],
    ['09:40', `This means the starlink satellite will need to switch to a new satellite in the network.`],
    ['09:45', `This can take time, the best figure I could find is about a minute [9] for the European`],
    ['09:49', `Space Agency’s Data Relay Satellite System, which is a currently operating geostationary`],
    ['09:54', `internet constellation designed to serve european imaging satellites, and other time critical`],
    ['10:00', `applications.`],
    ['10:01', `Such as serving emergency forces in remote areas, like those fighting forest fires.`],
    ['10:06', `Starlink may be faster, but it won’t be instantaneous, and thus it has 5 optical communication`],
    ['10:11', `systems on board to maintain a steady connection to 4 satellites at all times.`],
    ['10:17', `If we now use this system, transmitting from New York to London and back, with the shortest`],
    ['10:22', `path possible, using the speed of light in a vacuum as our transfer speed, we can achieve`],
    ['10:26', `a latency as low as 43 milliseconds.`],
    ['10:30', `Even if we took the shortest route possible with an optic fibre, which does not exist,`],
    ['10:35', `this would take about 55 milliseconds, a 28% decrease in speed.`],
    ['10:40', `The actual current return trip time for your average Joe is about 76 milliseconds, as we`],
    ['10:45', `saw earlier.`],
    ['10:46', `A 77% decrease in speed.`],
    ['10:49', `This is a huge deal for the two financial markets working out of these cities, with`],
    ['10:54', `millions of dollars being moved in fractions of a second, having a lower latency would`],
    ['10:59', `provide a massive advantage in capitalizing on price swings.`],
    ['11:03', `In fact, it wouldn’t be the first time a communications company has made a massive`],
    ['11:07', `investment to specifically serve these groups.`],
    ['11:10', `The Hibernian Express cable is a privately owned optic cable that is currently the lowest`],
    ['11:15', `latency connection between the NY4 data centre in Secaucus, New Jersey and the LD4 data centre`],
    ['11:24', `in Slough, England at just 59.95 milliseconds, 39.4% slower than our best time with Starlink.`],
    ['11:30', `[11] The previous best time was held by the AC-1 cable at 65 milliseconds.`],
    ['11:35', `At a cost of 300 million dollars this 5 millisecond increase in speed was justified to just connect`],
    ['11:43', `across the Atlantic.`],
    ['11:45', `Imagine how much these time sensitive industries will be willing to pay for a 17 millisecond`],
    ['11:50', `increase in speed.`],
    ['11:51', `It becomes even more valuable when you realise this time differential increases with increased`],
    ['11:57', `transmission distance.`],
    ['11:58', `New York to London is a relatively short distance.`],
    ['12:02', `The improvements would be even more pronounced for a London to Singapore transmission, for`],
    ['12:06', `every additional kilometre we travel the potential gains in speed increase rapidly [5].`],
    ['12:11', `[RI-2] But SpaceX aren’t just planning on serving this super fast internet to some customers,`],
    ['12:17', `they primarily advertise this system as a way to connect every human on this planet`],
    ['12:21', `to the internet, and they should have plenty of bandwidth left over to serve these people.`],
    ['12:26', `Although the internet has been one of the fastest growing technologies in human history,`],
    ['12:31', `by the end of 2019 more than half of the world's population will still be offline (4 billion).`],
    ['12:37', `Users will connect to this internet using a Starlink terminal which will cost around`],
    ['12:41', `$200 each, this will still be far outside the purchasing power of many third world citizens,`],
