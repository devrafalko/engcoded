    ['00:00', `This episode of Real Engineering is brought to you by Skillshare, home to over twenty`],
    ['00:04', `thousand classes that could teach you a new life skill.`],
    ['00:07', `As the world grapples to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy diet, electric cars`],
    ['00:12', `have seen an incredible boom over the past few years.`],
    ['00:15', `Last year, over one million electric cars were sold around the world.`],
    ['00:19', `The number of Nissan Leafs, Teslas, and other electric vehicles in circulation worldwide`],
    ['00:24', `is now more than three million.`],
    ['00:26', `And while there are many brands of electric car to choose from, there are only two choices`],
    ['00:30', `when it comes to powering electric vehicles: fuel cells or batteries.`],
    ['00:34', `Both produce electricity to drive electric motors, eliminating the pollution and inefficiencies`],
    ['00:39', `of the fossil fuel powered internal combustion engine.`],
    ['00:42', `Both hydrogen and electricity for batteries can be produced from low­ or zero ­carbon`],
    ['00:46', `sources, including renewable energy like solar and wind, and therefore both are being pursued`],
    ['00:51', `by car manufacturers and researchers as the possible future of electric vehicles.`],
    ['00:55', `However, a great debate is being waged by supporters of each technology.`],
    ['00:59', `Elon Musk has called hydrogen fuel cell technology “incredibly dumb,” claiming they’re`],
    ['01:04', `more of a marketing ploy for automakers than a long-term solution.`],
    ['01:08', `In contrast, Japan has announced its intention to become the world's first hydrogen society,`],
    ['01:13', `with the Japanese government and the auto industry working together to introduce 160`],
    ['01:18', `hydrogen stations and 40,000 fuel-cell vehicles by March 2021.`],
    ['01:22', `So which is actually better?`],
    ['01:24', `At first glance, hydrogen seems like an extremely clever way to power a car.`],
    ['01:29', `Compressed hydrogen has a specific energy (aka energy per unit mass) of neary 40,000`],
    ['01:32', `watt hours per kilogram.`],
    ['01:34', `Lithium ion batteries at best have a specific energy of just 278 wh/kg, but most fall around`],
    ['01:41', `167 wh / kg.`],
    ['01:42', `That's 236 times as much energy per kg for hydrogen.`],
    ['01:46', `And because of its energy density and lightweight nature, compressed hydrogen and fuel cells`],
    ['01:51', `can power cars for extended ranges without adding much weight, which as we saw in our`],
    ['01:55', `last video is a gigantic road block for incorporating the technology into the aviation industry.`],
    ['02:02', `The designers of electric vehicles are caught in a catch 22 with energy density and range.`],
    ['02:07', `Each extra kilogram of battery weight to increase range requires extra structural weight, heavier`],
    ['02:12', `brakes, a higher torque motor, and in turn more batteries to carry around this extra`],
    ['02:17', `mass, This weight compounding limits how far a battery powered vehicle can travel, until`],
    ['02:22', `new technology can help reduce the weight of the batteries.`],
    ['02:25', `For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, this weight compounding is not an issue.`],
    ['02:29', `Additionally, a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle can be refueled in under 5 minutes, where`],
    ['02:33', `a battery powered electric vehicle, like the Tesla model S, takes over 3 hours to fully`],
    ['02:38', `recharge.`],
    ['02:39', `When looking at the range and refuel times hydrogen can offer, you can see why some car`],
    ['02:43', `manufacturers are investing in this technology.`],
    ['02:46', `On the face of it.`],
    ['02:47', `Hydrogen is a clear winner, but it falls behind when we start considering the end-to-end production`],
    ['02:52', `process.`],
    ['02:53', `While both batteries and hydrogen fuel cells are both forms of electricity storage, the`],
    ['02:57', `cost differ drastically.`],
    ['02:59', `Fully charging a Tesla Model 3 with a 75 kiloWatt hour battery, costs between 10-12 dollars`],
    ['03:05', `depending where you live.`],
    ['03:07', `With a rated range of 500 kilometers, that’s between 2 and 2.4 cent per kilometer.`],
    ['03:12', `A great price.`],
    ['03:13', `In a previous video, I visited a petrol station that introduced a hydrogen pump, fed by its`],
    ['03:18', `own on-site production facility.`],
    ['03:20', `which used off-peak electricity to produce hydrogen.`],
    ['03:23', `The hydrogen from this station cost $85 dollars to fill the 5 kg tank of the Toyota Mirais`],
    ['03:29', `on site, which had a range of 480 kms.`],
    ['03:32', `That’s 17.7 cent per kilometer, 8 times the price.`],
    ['03:36', `And here lies the problem, Hydrogen simply requires more energy to produce.`],
    ['03:41', `To understand the economic viability of hydrogen let’s dig deeper into the production process.`],
    ['03:47', `Before any hydrogen vehicle can hit the road, you first need to produce the hydrogen, but`],
    ['03:51', `hydrogen is not a readily available energy source.`],
    ['03:54', `Even though hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it is usually stored`],
    ['03:58', `in water, hydrocarbons, such as methane, and other organic matter.`],
    ['04:02', `One of the challenges of using hydrogen as an energy storage mechanism comes from being`],
    ['04:07', `able to efficiently extract it from these compounds.`],
    ['04:10', `In the US, the majority of hydrogen is produced through a process called steam reforming.`],
    ['04:15', `Steam reforming is the process of combining high-temperature steam with natural gas to`],
    ['04:19', `extract hydrogen.`],
    ['04:21', `While steam reforming is the most common method of industrial hydrogen production, it requires`],
    ['04:25', `a good deal of heat and is wildly inefficient.`],
    ['04:29', `Hydrogen produced by steam reforming actually has less energy than the natural gas that`],
    ['04:34', `the steam reforming began with.`],
    ['04:36', `And while hydrogen fuel cells themselves don’t produce pollution, this process does.`],
    ['04:41', `So if we want to assume a future scenario with as little carbon emission as possible,`],
    ['04:45', `this method won’t cut it.`],
    ['04:47', `Another method to produce hydrogen is electrolysis - separating the hydrogen out of water using`],
    ['04:52', `an electric current.`],
    ['04:53', `While the electricity needed for this process can be provided from renewable sources, it`],
    ['04:58', `requires even more energy input than steam reforming.`],
    ['05:01', `You end up losing 30% of the energy from the original energy put in from the renewables`],
    ['05:07', `when you carry out electrolysis.`],
    ['05:09', `So we are sitting at 70% energy efficiency from hydrogen fuel cells if traditional electrolysis`],
    ['05:15', `is used, before the car even starts its engine.`],
    ['05:18', `A slightly more efficient method of producing hydrogen is polymer exchange membrane electrolysis.`],
    ['05:24', `Using this method, energy efficiencies can reach up to 80%, with the added benefit of`],
    ['05:28', `being produced on site, which we will get to in a moment.`],
    ['05:32', `But this is still a 20% loss of energy from the original electricity from the renewables.`],
    ['05:37', `Some experts say the efficiency of PEM electrolysis is expected to reach 82-86% before 2030, which`],
    ['05:44', `is a great improvement, but still well short of batteries charging efficiency at 99%.`],
    ['05:48', `[1] A 19% difference in production costs doesn’t explain the difference in costs yet, so where`],
    ['05:54', `else are we losing energy.`],
    ['05:56', `The next hurdle in getting hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on the road is the transport and`],
    ['06:00', `storage of the pure hydrogen.`],
    ['06:02', `If we assume the hydrogen is produced on site, like it was for this petrol station, then`],
    ['06:06', `we eliminate one energy sink, but the cost of storage is just as problematic.`],
    ['06:11', `Hydrogen is extremely low density as a gas and liquid, and so in order to achieve adequate`],
    ['06:16', `energy density, we have to increase its actual density.`],
    ['06:20', `We can do this in two ways.`],
    ['06:21', `We can compress the hydrogen to 790 times atmospheric pressure, but that takes energy,`],
    ['06:27', `about 13% of the total energy content of the hydrogen itself.`],
    ['06:32', `Alternatively we can turn hydrogen into liquid, cryogenically.`],
    ['06:36', `The advantage of hydrogen liquefaction is that a cryogenic hydrogen tank is much lighter`],
    ['06:40', `than a tank that can hold pressurized hydrogen.`],
    ['06:43', `But again, hydrogen's physical properties means hydrogen is harder to liquefy than any`],
    ['06:47', `other gas except helium.`],
    ['06:49', `Hydrogen is liquified by reducing its temperature to -253°C, with an efficiency loss of 40%,`],
    ['06:57', `once you factor in the added weight of the refrigerators and the refrigeration itself.`],
    ['07:01', `So pressurisation is a better option at a 13% energy loss.`],
    ['07:06', `Once the hydrogen is produced and compressed to a liquid or gas, a viable hydrogen infrastructure`],
    ['07:11', `requires that hydrogen be able to be delivered from where it's produced to the point of end-use,`],
    ['07:16', `such as a vehicle refueling station.`],
    ['07:18', `Where the hydrogen is produced can have a big impact on the cost and best method of`],
    ['07:23', `delivery.`],
    ['07:24', `For example, a large, centrally located hydrogen production facility can produce hydrogen at`],
    ['07:28', `a lower cost because it is producing more, but it costs more to deliver the hydrogen`],
    ['07:33', `because the point of use is farther away.`],
    ['07:35', `In comparison, distributed production facilities produce hydrogen on site so delivery costs`],
    ['07:40', `are relatively low, but the cost to produce the hydrogen is likely to be higher because`],
    ['07:45', `production volumes are less.`],
    ['07:47', `While there are some small-scale, on-site hydrogen production facilities being installed`],
    ['07:51', `at refuelling pumps, such as the station mentioned in the last hydrogen video.`],
    ['07:56', `until this infrastructure is widespread, we have to assume that the majority of hydrogen`],
    ['08:00', `is being transported by truck or pipeline, where we know that energy losses can range`],
    ['08:04', `from 10% up to 40%.`],
    ['08:07', `In comparison, assuming that the electricity that we use for charging the batteries comes`],
    ['08:11', `completely from renewable resources (like solar or wind), we just have to consider the`],
    ['08:14', `transmission losses in the grid.`],
    ['08:16', `Using the United States grid as a reference for typical grid losses, the average loss`],
    ['08:20', `is only 5%.`],
    ['08:22', `So in the best case scenario for hydrogen, using the most efficient means of production`],
    ['08:26', `and transport, we lose 20% of energy during PEM electrolysis, and around 13% for compression`],
    ['08:32', `and storage, amounting to a 33% loss.`],
    ['08:35', `In other systems, this could be as much as 56%.`],
    ['08:38', `For battery power, up to this point, we have lost just 6% to the grid and recharging.`],
    ['08:43', `Bringing our best case efficiency difference to 27% and our worst case to 50%.`],
    ['08:48', `The next stage of powering electric vehicles is what is called the tank to wheel conversion`],
    ['08:52', `efficiency.`],
    ['08:53', `For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, once the hydrogen is in the tank, it must be re-converted`],
    ['08:57', `into electric power.`],
    ['08:59', `This is done via a fuel cell, which essentially works like a PEM electrolyser, but in reverse.`],
    ['09:04', `In a PEM fuel cell, hydrogen gas flows through channels to the anode, where a catalyst causes`],
    ['09:08', `the hydrogen molecules to separate into protons and electrons.`],
    ['09:12', `Once again the membrane only allows protons to pass through it, while electrons flow through`],
    ['09:16', `an external circuit to the cathode.This flow of electrons is the electricity that is used`],
    ['09:21', `to power the vehicles electric motors.`],
    ['09:24', `If the fuel cell is powered with pure hydrogen, it has the potential to be up to around 60%`],
    ['09:29', `efficient, with most of the wasted energy lost to heat.`],
    ['09:32', `Like hydrogen fuel cells, batteries also come with inefficiencies and energy losses.`],
    ['09:36', `The grid provides AC current while the batteries store the charge in DC.`],
    ['09:40', `So to convert AC to DC, we need a charger.`],
    ['09:44', `Using the Tesla Model S as an example, its peak charger efficiency is around 92%.`],
    ['09:49', `The Tesla model S runs on AC motors; therefore, to convert the DC current supplied by the`],
    ['09:54', `batteries into AC current, an inverter has to be used with an efficiency of roughly 90%.`],
    ['09:59', `Additionally, lithium ion batteries can lose energy due to leakage.`],
    ['10:03', `A good estimate for the charging efficiency of a lithium ion battery is 90%.`],
    ['10:08', `All of these factors combined lead to a total efficiency of around 75%.`],
    ['10:13', `However, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles also have some of these same inefficiencies.`],
    ['10:17', `Any kind of electrolysis requires DC current, and therefore, a rectifier will be required`],
    ['10:22', `to convert the AC current from the grid to DC.`],
    ['10:25', `The conversion efficiency here is 92%.`],
    ['10:28', `We also need to convert the DC current produced by the fuel cell to AC to power the motor`],
    ['10:32', `through an inverter with an efficiency of 90%.`],
    ['10:35', `Finally, the efficiency of the motor must be considered for both fuel cell and battery`],
    ['10:40', `powered vehicles.`],
    ['10:41', `Currently, this is around 90-95% for both of them, which is amazing when you consider`],
    ['10:46', `that internal combustion engines running on petrol have an efficiency of only around 20-30%.`],
    ['10:52', `If we add up all these inefficiencies and compare current generation batteries, to the`],
    ['10:56', `best and worst case scenario of current gen hydrogen.`],
    ['10:59', `We can see how they measure up.`],
    ['11:01', `Even with the BEST case scenario.`],
    ['11:03', `Not taking into account any transport due to onsite production, and assuming very high`],
    ['11:08', `electrolysis efficiency of 80%, and assuming a HIGH fuel cell efficiency of 80%, hydrogen`],
    ['11:14', `still comes out at less than half the efficiency.`],
    ['11:17', `The worst case scenario is even worse off.`],
    ['11:19', `So while you may be able to go further on one fill-up of hydrogen in your fuel cell`],
    ['11:24', `vehicle over a battery powered electric vehicle, the cost that is needed to deliver that one`],
    ['11:29', `fill up would be astronomically higher compared to charging batteries due to these energy`],
    ['11:33', `losses and efficiencies.`],
    ['11:34', `Based on our worst case scenario, we would expect the cost per kilometre to be about`],
    ['11:39', `3.5 times greater for hydrogen, but as we saw earlier it’s actual 8 times the price.`],
    ['11:45', `So additional costs of production unrelated to efficiencies are obviously at play.`],
    ['11:49', `The cost of construction of the facility is one and the profit the station will take from`],
    ['11:53', `sale is another.`],
    ['11:55', `For now, these inefficiencies and costs are driving the market, where most investment`],
    ['11:59', `and research is going into battery powered electric vehicles.`],
    ['12:03', `So which wins?`],
    ['12:04', `Both are equally more green than internal combustion engines, assuming equal renewable`],
    ['12:08', `resources are used to power them.`],
    ['12:11', `Fuel cells allow for fast fill up times and long ranges; a big advantage.`],
    ['12:14', `But battery powered vehicles might catch up in range by the time there are enough hydrogen`],
    ['12:19', `stations to ever make fuel cell vehicles viable.`],
    ['12:22', `While fuel cells are efficient relative to combustion engines, they are not as efficient`],
    ['12:26', `as batteries.`],
    ['12:27', `They may make more sense for operation disconnected from the grid or as we saw in our last video`],
    ['12:32', `using hydrogen for planes actually could make a lot of sense, but once again that’s a`],
    ['12:36', `topic for another video.`],
    ['12:37', `For now, battery powered electric vehicles seem to be the sensible choice going forward`],
    ['12:42', `in the quest for pollution free consumer transport.`],
    ['12:45', `As battery-powered cars become more common, we’re also starting to see self-driving`],
    ['12:48', `cars become the norm.`],
    ['12:50', `If the job of driver is slowly automated away and consumers have a bunch of free time to`],
    ['12:54', `read or watch online video, it may be wise to use that opportunity to start learning`],
    ['12:59', `new skills and Skillshare is great place to do it.`],
    ['13:02', `You could take this course on Photoshop for beginners and learn a skill that has helped`],
    ['13:05', `this channel immensely.`],
    ['13:07', `You may have noticed that we introduced a new thumbnail design the channel.`],
    ['13:11', `This done in part because the channels views we trending downwards for past 2 months, despite`],
    ['13:15', `putting extra effort into production quality.`],
    ['13:18', `We needed to rethink our strategy for branding, and I felt the blueprints strength was that`],
    ['13:22', `it was easily recognisable as mine, but they all also look so similar it’s difficult`],
    ['13:27', `to tell when there is a new video.`],
    ['13:29', `So we got to work in photoshop to use the strengths of blueprint design and build on`],
    ['13:33', `its weaknesses and we can up with this transitioning effect.`],
    ['13:37', `Taking designs to reality, which I think fits the theme channel perfectly.`],
