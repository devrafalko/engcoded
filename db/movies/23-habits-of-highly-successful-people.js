    ['00:03', `Hi everyone.`],
    ['00:04', `Welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:06', `Today I want to share`],
    ['00:07', `23 habits of highly successful people.`],
    ['00:09', `These are habits that I've learned`],
    ['00:10', `from reading books, articles, and also, casually interviewing the most successful people`],
    ['00:15', `I know in my life.`],
    ['00:16', `These are habits that I think are really important for all of us to be aware of,`],
    ['00:20', `but don't worry if you're not super great at all of these habits.`],
    ['00:24', `Nobody's perfect.`],
    ['00:25', `The first step is to be aware of the habit, and the next step is to just work on it every`],
    ['00:29', `day.`],
    ['00:30', `It's always a practice.`],
    ['00:31', `Alright, here we go.`],
    ['00:33', `The most successful people always take full responsibility for their life.`],
    ['00:37', `They never complain, nor do they blame others for their problems.`],
    ['00:41', `They take responsibility for all the good AND the bad in their life.`],
    ['00:45', `They know that even though they can’t always control what happens TO them,`],
    ['00:49', `they can always control how they RESPOND to those events.`],
    ['00:52', `They can choose to respond in a positive and productive way.`],
    ['00:56', `Because of this, successful people are always optimistic for their future.`],
    ['01:00', `Next: Successful people always know their priorities and do the most important tasks`],
    ['01:05', `first.`],
    ['01:06', `They know that the content of what they work on MATTERS.`],
    ['01:09', `So it’s better to be effective`],
    ['01:11', `on the right tasks, than efficient with the smaller, less meaningful tasks.`],
    ['01:16', `Successful people also create their own morning routine.`],
    ['01:19', `The key to super productive days`],
    ['01:21', `is to start them right.`],
    ['01:23', `Choose activities that energize and inspire you, see what daily tasks`],
    ['01:26', `you can get out of the way early on, and build your morning around those tasks.`],
    ['01:31', `I personally like to drink water, take my vitamins, journal, and exercise before I start`],
    ['01:36', `working.`],
    ['01:37', `Next: Most successful people practice daily meditation or some sort of mindfulness practice,`],
    ['01:42', `whether it’s journaling, morning pages, or something like the Five Minute Journal.`],
    ['01:46', `Tim Ferriss stated that out of all the successful people he’s interviewed,`],
    ['01:49', `more than 80% have some form of meditation or mindfulness practice every day.`],
    ['01:55', `Another key to success is to make health and exercise a priority.`],
    ['01:59', `Research says that regular exercise and a healthy diet can lead to higher levels of`],
    ['02:03', `productivity,`],
    ['02:04', `happiness, motivation, and, not surprisingly, your ability to live longer.`],
    ['02:09', `Successful people`],
    ['02:10', `take care of their bodies because they know it affects all other areas of their life.`],
    ['02:15', `Another habit that all successful people have in common is they read and learn continuously.`],
    ['02:21', `Bill Gates reads 50 books a year.`],
    ['02:23', `Warren Buffett reads 600-1000 pages a day.`],
    ['02:26', `Elon Musk learned how to build rocket ships by reading books.`],
    ['02:30', `But successful people don’t just read anything.`],
    ['02:32', `They're highly selective about what they read,`],
    ['02:34', `so they usually choose knowledge and learning over entertaining books.`],
    ['02:39', `Another key habit is to have discipline and self-control.`],
    ['02:42', `Successful people know`],
    ['02:43', `how to stay focused and not fall for distractions or FOMO.`],
    ['02:47', `Their priorities are solid, and they keep their eyes on the goal.`],
    ['02:51', `The most successful people are also extremely consistent.`],
    ['02:54', `There’s so much power in consistency,`],
    ['02:56', `because small consistent actions is how you build anything great.`],
    ['03:00', `To practice your consistency, try doing something for 21 days straight.`],
    ['03:04', `If you fall off, start the 21 days over again.`],
    ['03:07', `The longer you can stay consistent at something,`],
    ['03:09', `the more likely you will succeed at it.`],
    ['03:12', `Successful people will also follow through with what they say.`],
    ['03:15', `They take their promises`],
    ['03:16', `and commitments seriously.`],
    ['03:18', `When they say they are going to do something,`],
    ['03:20', `they are going to do it.`],
    ['03:21', `They don’t give excuses, only results.`],
    ['03:25', `Another thing they do is they persist and persevere.`],
    ['03:28', `Successful people don’t give up easily.`],
    ['03:30', `They stay in the game no matter what.`],
    ['03:33', `One quote that I constantly told myself`],
    ['03:34', `and wrote in my phone in the beginning of my career was:`],
    ['03:37', `“No matter how hard it is or how bad it gets, I’m going to make it!”`],
    ['03:42', `That mindset seriously helped me stay persistent in reaching my goals.`],
    ['03:46', `Successful people also aren’t afraid to fail.`],
    ['03:49', `They know that failure is good,`],
    ['03:50', `because failure is just a learning opportunity.`],
    ['03:53', `It teaches you what doesn’t work,`],
    ['03:54', `so you can try something else.`],
    ['03:56', `Oprah says, “There is no such thing as failure.`],
    ['04:00', `Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction.”`],
    ['04:03', `The most successful people hone their craft daily and sharpen the saw.`],
    ['04:07', `What they do is, they work on their craft every day, by practicing and making small`],
    ['04:11', `improvements,`],
    ['04:12', `so that over time they become very, very good at what they do.`],
    ['04:16', `Ask yourself: What’s your craft?`],
    ['04:18', `What skills are important for your career?`],
    ['04:20', `And then work on sharpening those skills every day.`],
    ['04:24', `Another habit is to be self-aware.`],
    ['04:26', `Successful people know their strengths and their weaknesses,`],
    ['04:29', `and use them to their advantage.`],
    ['04:31', `They know how they are doing, and they are aware`],
    ['04:33', `of the areas where they need to improve.`],
    ['04:35', `So they're confident, but they’re also humble.`],
    ['04:38', `Another habit is to practice gratitude.`],
    ['04:40', `Tony Robbins says, “Success without gratitude`],
    ['04:43', `is the biggest failure of all.”`],
    ['04:45', `Gratitude is the key to living a happy and successful life.`],
    ['04:49', `Without it you’ll always be yearning for more, more, and more.`],
    ['04:52', `With gratitude, you’ll know how wonderful your life already is,`],
    ['04:55', `and be thankful for how far you’ve already come.`],
    ['04:58', `Successful people also have a solid support system.`],
    ['05:01', `Whether it's a partner, friends, family,`],
    ['05:02', `a mentor, coach, or some sort of community.`],
    ['05:05', `It doesn’t have to be a big group.`],
    ['05:07', `It can be just a handful of people to rely on and bounce ideas off of.`],
    ['05:12', `Another key thing that all successful people do is: They surround themselves`],
    ['05:15', `with like-minded achievers.`],
    ['05:17', `I’m sure we’ve all heard of the quote,`],
    ['05:19', `“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with,” and it’s`],
    ['05:23', `so true.`],
    ['05:24', `Successful people surround themselves with people they can learn from`],
    ['05:27', `and people who inspire them in their journey.`],
    ['05:30', `Successful people are also goal oriented.`],
    ['05:33', `Not only do they SET goals,`],
    ['05:34', `they also make the detailed plans on how to achieve those goals,`],
    ['05:38', `and then follow through with their plans.`],
    ['05:40', `They know that execution is more important than ideas.`],
    ['05:45', `Another habit of successful people is: They are proactive and take initiative.`],
    ['05:48', `They don’t wait around for things to just fall in their lap.`],
    ['05:52', `If they want something,`],
    ['05:53', `they go out and make it happen.`],
    ['05:56', `Successful people also know how to manage their emotions.`],
    ['05:58', `They are aware of how their emotions influence their thoughts and behavior,`],
    ['06:02', `and so they learn how to detach from any emotions that aren’t serving them.`],
    ['06:06', `They know there is a right place and time for exploring their emotions.`],
    ['06:10', `Sometimes you have to set your emotions aside to get the work done.`],
    ['06:14', `Successful people also communicate clearly.`],
    ['06:16', `Every great leader is a great communicator.`],
    ['06:18', `They speak with authority and confidence.`],
    ['06:20', `And they talk about their ideas`],
    ['06:21', `in a way that connects deeply with their audience and moves them.`],
    ['06:25', `These people are also great listeners.`],
    ['06:28', `They listen to what others have to say,`],
    ['06:30', `ask questions, and write things down.`],
    ['06:31', `They do this so that they can learn`],
    ['06:33', `and fully understand a situation, or get the details right in fixing a situation.`],
    ['06:38', `You'll also find that the most successful people value their alone time.`],
    ['06:42', `They take time alone to think and connect to their intuition,`],
    ['06:46', `which helps give them a clearer direction in life.`],
    ['06:48', `They use that alone time`],
    ['06:49', `to recharge but also strategize for their future.`],
    ['06:53', `Lastly, most successful people love the journey more than the result.`],
    ['06:58', `They learn how to enjoy the process, rather than do everything for the end goal.`],
    ['07:02', `That’s how they stay committed, consistent, and persistent for the long run.`],
    ['07:07', `Ultimately, that means that if you love what you do,`],
    ['07:09', `then you have the best chance to be successful at it.`],
    ['07:12', `Alright, those were 23 habits of highly successful people.`],
    ['07:16', `Of course, there are more habits,`],
    ['07:18', `but I think this was a pretty good start.`],
    ['07:20', `If you want to pin this graphic, you can go to my blog post.`],
    ['07:23', `The link is in the description below.`],
    ['07:25', `Make sure to subscribe and click that bell`],
