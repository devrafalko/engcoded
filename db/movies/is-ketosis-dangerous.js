    ['01:50', `This meant that anatomists were much more likely to get their hands on the body of a`],

    ['01:56', `So... what about the thymus?`],
    ['01:59', `Well, people facing the hardships that come from being poor, are of course going to be`],
    ['02:03', `under a lot of stress.`],
    ['02:05', `Chronic stress.`],
    ['02:06', `Nowadays we’re very familiar with the fact that chronic stress leads to all types of`],
    ['02:09', `diseases, and that it can atrophy certain organs.`],
    ['02:12', `In the case of the thymus, stress can reduce its size by as much as 75%.`],
    ['02:18', `So what ended up being recorded into the anatomy books as a normal thymus gland was actually`],
    ['02:23', `a thymus that was severely reduced in size.`],
    ['02:26', `Then, in the 1900’s a german anatomist called Paltauf was trying to find the cause of Sudden`],
    ['02:31', `Infant Death syndrome.`],
    ['02:33', `Manny middle and upper class babies were abruptly dying of this.`],
    ['02:36', `So Paltauf examines the bodies of these higher class babies and notices that their thymus`],
    ['02:41', `glands appear to be abnormally large.`],
    ['02:44', `So he concluded that if you wanted to be a good parent you should irradiate the thymus`],
    ['02:48', `gland of your child to make it smaller and prevent sudden infant death syndrome.`],
    ['02:52', `By the 1920’s all the leading pediatric textbooks were offering this advice.`],
    ['02:56', `Paltauf of course didn’t realize that he was simply someone who had the rare chance`],
    ['03:00', `to look at the bodies of children whose thymus was not affected by the chronic stress of`],
    ['03:05', `poverty.`],
    ['03:06', `Unfortunately this misunderstanding persisted well into the 1950’s, having several thousands`],
    ['03:11', `of people die from irradiation induced cancer.`],
    ['03:14', `So, what does any of this have to do with ketosis?`],
    ['03:18', `Well, ketones also have the misfortune of being misunderstood due to how they were discovered.`],
    ['03:23', `Physicians first noticed ketones in the latter part of the 19th century, when they were noticed`],
    ['03:27', `to be in abundance in the urine of patients in a diabetic coma.`],
    ['03:31', `It was understood that a vast overproduction of ketones was responsible for the terrible`],
    ['03:35', `symptoms of something called diabetic ketoacidosis.`],
    ['03:39', `So for half a century ketones were thought to be the very negative product of impaired`],
    ['03:43', `carbohydrate utilization.`],
    ['03:45', `Only after technology and analytical techniques improved did we understand that ketone bodies`],
    ['03:49', `are perfectly normal components of the blood.`],
    ['03:52', `Even if you’re not technically in ketosis, Ketone bodies are always present in the blood`],
    ['03:56', `of a healthy person and their levels increase the longer you go without food.`],
    ['04:00', `After an overnight fast, ketone bodies supply 2–6% of the body's energy requirements,`],
    ['04:06', `while they supply 30–40% of the energy needs after a 3-day fast.`],
    ['04:10', `Before we continue, being in ketosis through fasting or diet is nothing like diabetic ketoacidosis.`],
    ['04:16', `Ketoacidosis involves exorbitant levels of ketone production, far higher than what you`],
    ['04:20', `could achieve even when fasting for weeks.`],
    ['04:23', `Being worried about ketoacidosis through diet or fasting is like worrying that eating at`],
    ['04:27', `a sushi restaurant is going to put you in brief coma just like that one kid who chugged`],
    ['04:31', `a bottle of soy sauce on a dare.`],
    ['04:35', `So not only are ketones normally found in healthy people, but it’s been found that`],
    ['04:38', `certain tissues prefer to use ketone bodies.`],
    ['04:42', `In fact, as is explained in the Biochemistry textbook published by W.H. Freeman “Fatty`],
    ['04:46', `acids are the heart's main source of fuel, although ketone bodies as well as lactate`],
    ['04:50', `can serve as fuel for heart muscle.`],
    ['04:52', `In fact, heart muscle consumes acetoacetate (a ketone body) in preference to glucose.”`],
    ['04:58', `Some people actually purposely enter ketosis through fasting in order to improve mental`],
    ['05:02', `performance.`],
    ['05:03', `A study at the University of Cambridge concluded that a ketogenic diet “improved physical`],
    ['05:07', `performance and cognitive function in rats, and its energy-sparing properties suggest`],
    ['05:11', `that it may help to treat a range of human conditions with metabolic abnormalities.”`],
    ['05:15', `I guess Plato figured this out for himself when he said “I fast for greater physical`],
    ['05:20', `and mental efficiency."`],
    ['05:22', `Going without food for better cognitive function may sound ridiculous considering it was for`],
    ['05:26', `a long while thought that the brain can run only on glucose (carbohydrates).`],
    ['05:30', `George Cahill and his group at Harvard Medical School demonstrated in 1967 that the brain`],
    ['05:36', `can use ketone bodies as a source of energy.`],
    ['05:40', `What he found was that during starvation, ketones are the predominant fuel for the peripheral`],
    ['05:44', `tissues and the brain, with the brain deriving more than two thirds of its energy from ketone`],
    ['05:49', `bodies.`],
    ['05:51', `Despite this, the body still requires some glucose, even when you aren’t eating anything.`],
    ['05:55', `For example red blood cells')} can’t run off of ketone bodies because they don’t have`],
    ['05:59', `any mitochondria to metabolize them with.`],
    ['06:02', `But all of the body’s glucose needs are met by the fact that the body can make its`],
    ['06:06', `own glucose, for example it can make glucose from the glycerol backbone of fat.`],
    ['06:11', `For this reason, even during prolonged fasting, people will keep a stable blood glucose level.`],
    ['06:17', `This also illustrates that there is actually no dietary requirement for carbohydrate.`],
    ['06:22', `Of course vegetables and some fruit are very important because they have all kinds of micronutrients`],
    ['06:26', `and fiber, but your body doesn’t actually require the carbohydrate inside those foods.`],
    ['06:32', `I’m not necessarily saying a zero carbohydrate diet is best, just that it’s very possible`],
    ['06:37', `to live without dietary carbohydrate assuming you get enough fat and protein.`],
    ['06:42', `There are essential amino acids and there are essential fatty acids - types of protein`],
    ['06:47', `and fat you must get from the diet.`],
    ['06:49', `However, there is no such thing as an essential dietary carbohydrate - your body is perfectly`],
    ['06:54', `capable of making as much glucose as it needs.`],
    ['06:59', `In fact, in the absence of dietary carbohydrate, the brain runs so efficiently off of ketone`],
    ['07:04', `bodies that you can drastically deplete glucose levels of people in deep ketosis and it won’t`],
    ['07:09', `affect them.`],
    ['07:10', `A 1972 paper describes an ethically questionable study where overweight patients fasted for`],
    ['07:16', `2 months, putting them in deep ketosis meaning they were producing a very large amount of`],
    ['07:21', `ketone bodies.`],
    ['07:22', `Insulin was then infused into these patients until their blood glucose went as low`],
    ['07:27', `as 9mg per deciliter - a level that should cause coma or death.`],
    ['07:30', `However, the patients didn’t really react to this.`],
    ['07:33', `There was no particular change in cognition, nor did their body react to the drastic drop`],
    ['07:37', `in blood sugar.`],
    ['07:38', `"The only people in the room who had palpations and sweating and anxiety were the physicians.`],
    ['07:44', `The people who had the blood sugar levels that should be associated with coma or death`],
    ['07:49', `were completely unphased.`],
    ['07:51', `Had completely normal mentation.`],
    ['07:52', `It is clear that the human brain is perfectly happy with beta hydroxybutyrate as not just`],
    ['07:58', `its majority fuel, but essentially its sole fuel."`],
    ['08:02', `Actually anyone watching this video would have, at at least one point in their lives,`],
    ['08:06', `been in a similar situation where blood glucose is very low and ketone utilization is very`],
    ['08:11', `high in their bodies.`],
    ['08:13', `It’s estimated that a newborn’s brain consumes on average between 60 and 71% of`],
    ['08:18', `its body’s energy budget.`],
    ['08:20', `Compare that to the lowly 25% of the body’s energy budget an adult brain uses.`],
    ['08:25', `Despite this massive need for energy, a newborn’s blood glucose level is incredibly low at around`],
    ['08:30', `35mg per deciliter.`],
    ['08:31', `This is half of the lower end of a normal adult’s blood glucose level.`],
    ['08:35', `This means that the newborn’s brain would have to be deriving more than half of its`],
    ['08:39', `energy from ketone bodies.`],
    ['08:42', `In his book on the health potential of ketones, Dr. Muneta Tetsuo, director of Muneta Maternity`],
    ['08:46', `Clinic in Japan explains that pregnant women, whether they are restricting carbohydrate`],
    ['08:51', `or not are producing higher than normal levels of ketones.`],
    ['08:55', `By comparing the mother’s blood with the newborn’s umbilical cord blood, he found`],
    ['08:59', `that out of 416 cases, 70% of babies were born with even higher levels of ketones than`],
    ['09:06', `that of the mother.`],
    ['09:07', `By analyzing the villi that provide contact with the mother's blood to the fetal membrane,`],
    ['09:11', `Muneta deduced that the fetus must be living in an environment of elevated ketones from`],
    ['09:17', `the start of pregnancy.`],
    ['09:19', `And, even a month after birth, babies on average had a blood ketone level 5 times higher than`],
    ['09:25', `that of a normal person.`],
    ['09:27', `As Muneta wrote in his book: “Newborns are living off of ketones!”`],
    ['09:32', `Not only is ketosis helpful for supplying the energy needs of the newborn baby, it may`],
    ['09:36', `also be an important factor in the development of the brain.`],
    ['09:40', `It’s been understood that exercise is beneficial for the brain because it increases the level`],
    ['09:44', `of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor - BDNF, which is a protein that promotes the growth`],
    ['09:50', `of new brain cells.`],
    ['09:52', `Because of this, Dr. John Ratey of Harvard Medical School has given BDNF the nickname`],
    ['09:55', `of “miracle gro for the brain.”`],
    ['09:58', `However, the mechanism for how exercise triggers BDNF was not clear for some time, until a`],
    ['10:03', `paper came out last year that was headed by Assistant Professor of Biochemistry Dr. Sama`],
    ['10:08', `Sleiman.`],
    ['10:09', `I think the title is quite straightforward: “Exercise promotes the expression of brain`],
    ['10:13', `derived neurotrophic factor through the action of the ketone body beta hydroxybutyrate.`],
    ['10:20', `Growth of the brain is very important in a more broad sense as well - growing a big brain`],
    ['10:24', `is of course what allowed us to become human.`],
    ['10:26', `And when it comes to human evolution, efficiency is the name of the game.`],
    ['10:31', `That is our bodies had to develop methods for more efficient extraction and utilization`],
    ['10:35', `of energy, mainly to support our big energy hungry brain.`],
    ['10:40', `One tradeoff for a bigger brain was a smaller gut- less energy spent on the gut meant more`],
    ['10:45', `for the brain.`],
    ['10:47', `As is stated in a Public Library of Science article titled "Man the Fat Hunter," to adjust`],
    ['10:51', `for the high metabolic cost of a large brain “…shrinkage in gut size was a necessary`],
    ['10:56', `accompaniment.`],
    ['10:57', `… A shorter human gut, had evolved to be more dependent on nutrient and energy-dense`],
    ['11:02', `foods than other primates.`],
    ['11:04', `A smaller gut is less efficient at extracting sufficient energy and nutrition from fibrous`],
    ['11:08', `foods and considerably more dependent on higher-density, higher bio-available foods that require less`],
    ['11:14', `energy for their digestion per unit of energy / nutrition released.”`],
    ['11:20', `This implicates fat as an important food source because it is obviously very energy dense,`],
    ['11:25', `providing 9 calories per gram.`],
    ['11:28', `But the efficiency of using fat for fuel is deeper than just calories.`],
    ['11:32', `Also, our brains’ power and capacity for intellect comes not just from the increase`],
    ['11:36', `in size, but also from enhanced blood flow and efficient use of oxygen.`],
    ['11:42', `Roger Seymour of the University of Adelaide and his team found that bloodflow to the brain`],
    ['11:47', `increased at an unexpectedly rapid pace over a period of 3 million years.`],
    ['11:53', `Seymour says: “While brain size was increasing 3.5 times, blood flow rate surprisingly increased`],
    ['11:58', `six hundred percent, from about 1.2ml per second to 7ml per second.`],
    ['12:04', `...This indicates that our brains are six times as hungry for oxygen as those of our`],
    ['12:08', `ancestors, presumably because our cognitive ability is greater and therefore more energy-intensive.”`],
    ['12:15', `This would suggest that the most important fuel for the brain is going to be one that`],
    ['12:19', `uses oxygen more efficiently.`],
    ['12:22', `And this is exactly what ketones do.`],
    ['12:25', `Dr. Richard L Veech found in 1994 that administering ketone bodies to a rat heart led to a 25%`],
    ['12:32', `increase in hydraulic work, but a decrease in oxygen consumption.`],
    ['12:37', `Theodore VanItallie explained this phenomenon in a 2003 article by saying that the ketone`],
    ['12:42', `body beta hydroxybutyrate increases the efficiency of energy production in the cell’s mitochondria.`],
    ['12:49', `If you were schooled in the states and attended even a day of biology class, you would know`],
    ['12:53', `that mitochondria are the “powerhouses of the cell.”`],
    ['12:56', `But is this improvement in efficiency happening in the powerhouses of the brain cells?`],
    ['13:01', `Well, Vanitallie says that`],
    ['13:03', `“Studies of blood flow and oxygen consumption in the brains of food-deprived obese human`],
    ['13:07', `subjects revealed values that were well below the normal levels for adult human brains...`],
    ['13:13', `they suggest an increase in the metabolic efficiency in human brains using ketoacids`],
    ['13:18', `as their principal energy source in place of glucose.”`],
    ['13:22', `People who have done extended fasts will sometimes report a euphoric or drastically enhanced`],

    ['13:40', `In essence ketone bodies may be a preferred fuel source for the brain as they provide`],
