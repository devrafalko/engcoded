    ['00:00', `Electric cars are making big waves in the automobile world`],
    ['00:04', `These noise-free, pollution-fre and high-performance] vehicles are expected to make their IC engine counterparts obsolete by 2025`],
    ['00:14', `This video will unveil the hidden technologies behind the Tesla model S which recently became the world's fastest accelerating car`],
    ['00:24', `We will see how electric cars have achieved superior performance by analyzing the technology behind the induction motor,`],
    ['00:31', `inverter`],
    ['00:34', `Lithium-Ion battery Power source,`],
    ['00:37', `and, above all, the synchronized vehicle mechanism, in a logical step-by-step Manner`],
    ['00:45', `The powerhouse of the tesla car is an invention made by the great scientist Nikola Tesla around 100 Years back: the induction motor`],
    ['00:54', `The induction Motor has two main parts: the stator and the rotor`],
    ['01:00', `You can see the construction details of the motor here`],
    ['01:07', `The rotor is simply a collection of conducting bars short-circuited by end rings`],
    ['01:17', `A three-phase AC power input is given to the stator`],
    ['01:21', `The three-phase alternating current in the coils produces a rotating magnetic field. The tesla motor produces a four-pole Magnetic field.`],
    ['01:31', `This rotating magnetic field that induces current on the rotor bars to make it turn`],
    ['01:37', `In an induction motor the rotor always lags behind the RMF.`],
    ['01:42', `An induction motor has neither brushes nor a permanent magnet. At the same time it is robust and powerful.`],
    ['01:50', `The beauty of an induction motor is that its speed depends on the frequency of the AC power supply.`],
    ['01:56', `So just by varying the frequency of the power supply, we will be able to alter the drive wheel speed`],
    ['02:03', `This simple fact makes electric car speed control easy and reliable`],
    ['02:08', `The motor Supply is from a variable frequency drive, which in turn controls motor speed.`],
    ['02:15', `The motor speed can range from Zero to 18,000 rpm.`],
    ['02:20', `This is the most sizable advantage electric cars have when compared to internal combustion cars.`],
    ['02:27', `An Internal Combustion engine produces usable torque and power output only within limited speed range`],
    ['02:36', `Therefore, directly connecting the engine rotation to the drive wheel is not a clever idea.`],
    ['02:45', `A transmission must be introduced to vary the drive wheel speed`],
    ['02:49', `On the other hand an induction motor will work efficiently in any speed range`],
    ['02:55', `Thus no speed varying transmission is needed for an electric car`],
    ['03:02', `moreover an IC engine does not produce direct rotational motion`],
    ['03:07', `The linear motion of the piston has to be converted to rotational motion`],
    ['03:13', `This causes major problems for mechanical balancing`],
    ['03:17', `Not only is the internal combustion engine not self-started like an induction motor`],
    ['03:22', `further, the power output of an IC engine is always uneven`],
    ['03:26', `Many accessories are needed to solve these issues`],
    ['03:30', `On the other hand you will have direct rotational motion and uniform power output with an induction motor`],
    ['03:36', `many components in the IC engine can be avoided here`],
    ['03:40', `As a result of these factors, a great response rate and higher power to weight ratio comes naturally to an induction motor resulting in superior`],
    ['03:48', `vehicle Performance`],
    ['03:52', `But from where does the motor receive power?`],
    ['03:56', `From a battery pack`],
    ['03:58', `the battery Produces DC power`],
    ['04:01', `so before supply get to a motor it has to be converted to AC`],
    ['04:06', `An inverter is used for this purpose`],
    ['04:09', `This power electronic device also controls the Ac power frequency thus controlling the motor speed`],
    ['04:16', `Moreover the Inverter can even vary the amplitude of the ac power which in turn will control the motor power output`],
    ['04:24', `Thus the inverter acts as the brain of the electric car`],
    ['04:29', `Now let's turn our focus to the battery pack`],
    ['04:34', `You will be amazed to find that they are just a collection of common lithium-ion cells similar to those used in your daily life`],
    ['04:43', `The cells are connected in a combination of series and parallel to produce the power required to run your electric car`],
    ['04:49', `Glycol coolant is passed through metallic inner tubes through the gap between the cells`],
    ['04:54', `This is one principal innovation of Tesla`],
    ['04:57', `by using many small cells instead of a few big cells`],
    ['05:01', `Effective cooling is guaranteed`],
    ['05:04', `This minimizes thermal hot spots and even temperature distribution is achieved leading to higher battery pack life`],
    ['05:12', `The cells are arranged as detachable modules`],
    ['05:16', `There are 16 such modules in the battery pack constituting around 7,000 cells`],
    ['05:24', `The heated Glycol is cooled down by passing through a radiator, which is fitted at the front of the vehicle`],
    ['05:33', `Moreover you can see how such a low height battery pack when fitted close to the ground level will lower the vehicle center of gravity`],
    ['05:44', `The lower of gravity improves the stability of the car considerably`],
    ['05:49', `The large battery pack is also spread across the floor offering structural rigidity against side collisions`],
    ['05:59', `Now let's get back to Tesla's drivetrain`],
    ['06:03', `The power produced by the motor is transferred to the drive wheels via a gearbox`],
    ['06:10', `As previously discussed, tesla model s uses a simple`],
    ['06:14', `Single speed transmission because the motor is efficient in a wide range of operating conditions`],
    ['06:21', `You can see that output speed from the motor is reduced in two steps`],
    ['06:28', `Even achieving the reverse gear is quite easy in an electric car. Just change the order of the power phase for this`],
    ['06:40', `The only purpose of electric car transmission is speed reduction and associated torque multiplication`],
    ['06:49', `The second component in the Gearbox is a differential`],
    ['06:53', `The reduced speed drive is passed to it`],
    ['06:57', `You can see this is a simple open differential. However, open differentials, have a problem of traction control`],
    ['07:07', `But why does such an advanced car use an open differential rather than a limited slip differential?`],
    ['07:12', `The answer is that the open differential is more rugged and can carry more torque`],
    ['07:19', `A problem that occurs in an open differential can effectively be overcome with help of two methods: selective braking and`],
    ['07:27', `cutting the power supply`],
    ['07:30', `In an Internal combustion engine this power supply cut by cutting the fuel is not so responsive`],
    ['07:39', `In an induction motor, however, the power supply cut is quite responsive and an effective means for obtaining traction control`],
    ['07:46', `In the tesla this can all be accomplished using a state-of-the-art algorithm with help from Sensors and controllers`],
    ['07:53', `In short, Tesla Motors has replaced a complex mechanical hardware system with smart,`],
    ['07:58', `responsive software`],
    ['08:01', `Did you know an electric car could be driven efficiently with the help of just one pedal?`],
    ['08:08', `This is due to its powerful regenerative braking system`],
    ['08:13', `That means saving the huge kinetic energy of the car in the form of electricity without wasting it as heat`],
    ['08:20', `In an electric car, as soon as you release the accelerator pedal the regenerative braking comes into action`],
    ['08:29', `The interesting thing is that during the regenerative braking the same induction motor acts as a generator`],
    ['08:38', `Here the wheels drive the rotor of the induction motor`],
    ['08:43', `We know in an induction motor the rotor speed is less than the RMF speed`],
    ['08:48', `To convert the motor to a generator. You just have to make sure that the rotor speed is greater than the RMF speed`],
    ['08:59', `The inverter plays a crucial role here in adjusting the input power frequency and keeping the RMF speed below the rotor speed`],
    ['09:08', `This will generate electricity in the stator coils, which is way higher than the supplied electricity`],
    ['09:15', `The generated electricity can then be stored in the battery pack after the conversion`],
    ['09:22', `An opposing electromagnetic force acts on the rotor during this process, so the drive wheels and the car will slow down`],
    ['09:31', `This way vehicle speed can be accurately controlled during the drive using a single pedal`],
    ['09:39', `The brake Pedal can be applied for a complete stop`],
    ['09:44', `As you might already be aware, electric cars are much safer than internal combustion cars`],
    ['09:52', `The cost of maintaining and driving an electric car is much lower than that of an IC engine car`],
    ['09:57', `With the drawbacks of the electric car evaded through the advent of improved technology, electric cars promise to be the cars of the future`],
    ['10:07', `We think mr.. J. Who Garcia an electric car expert and youtuber for his technical support for this video?`],
    ['10:14', `Your support at patreon.com is highly appreciated. It enables us to make additional free educational videos for you. Thank you`]
