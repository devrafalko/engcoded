    ['00:04', `Hey guys, welcome back to Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:05', `So good to see you.`],
    ['00:06', `Today I'm sharing six life lessons that I've learned lately.`],
    ['00:10', `And before I get into it, I want to announce that next week,`],
    ['00:13', `we are coming out with new Pastel Notebooks on our shop,`],
    ['00:17', `so get excited for that!`],
    ['00:18', `And if you haven't heard, I'm doing a Journaling Series on IGTV to celebrate that launch.`],
    ['00:23', `Every Saturday for the next six weeks`],
    ['00:26', `we're doing a journaling video on a different topic or area of life.`],
    ['00:30', `And there's emails that go along with the videos,`],
    ['00:32', `sharing journaling prompts that you guys can do.`],
    ['00:34', `So, if you love journaling, I'll post all the links down below`],
    ['00:36', `on the videos and the email series.`],
    ['00:39', `Alright, so the first lesson I want to share today is`],
    ['00:41', `something that I talked about recently,`],
    ['00:42', `but I think it's worth sharing again in a more concise and clear way.`],
    ['00:47', `If you want to get that feeling of satisfaction out of life,`],
    ['00:51', `you can't just pursue what makes you happy.`],
    ['00:54', `You have to pursue a life that you are proudof,`],
    ['00:57', `and pursuing a life you're proud of means`],
    ['01:00', `doing things outside of your comfort zone,`],
    ['01:02', `pushing yourself, stretching your boundaries a little,`],
    ['01:06', `doing things that are not necessarily pleasant,`],
    ['01:08', `but things that would help you in the long run,`],
    ['01:12', `things that are investments to yourself.`],
    ['01:14', `Focusing on happiness is great, and happiness is important,`],
    ['01:17', `but you have to check yourself and make sure you don't run the risk of`],
    ['01:21', `staying within what's in your comfort zone`],
    ['01:25', `and doing only the things that make you happy in your comfort zone,`],
    ['01:27', `things that are pleasurable, safe, and easy for you,`],
    ['01:30', `because I think you can fall into that trap,`],
    ['01:33', `because when you do things outside of your comfort zone,`],
    ['01:36', `it's very unpleasant.`],
    ['01:38', `You might not be happy.`],
    ['01:39', `You might have to do things that are scary,`],
    ['01:41', `but after doing those things – maybe after failing, after falling down –`],
    ['01:46', `you will feel proud of yourself.`],
    ['01:48', `You will grow after that.`],
    ['01:50', `And that is a life that is more fulfilling`],
    ['01:53', `than if you were to just stay within the confines`],
    ['01:55', `of what makes you happy and what feels good and what's comfortable.`],
    ['01:59', `Happiness is such a broad term, you know?`],
    ['02:01', `You can fall into the happiness of doing what's easy and the happiness of being lazy.`],
    ['02:06', `You know, I totally enjoy being lazy sometimes and doing nothing.`],
    ['02:10', `But if you do that for too long,`],
    ['02:11', `you're going to feel like a slob`],
    ['02:13', `and you're not going to be proud of yourself.`],
    ['02:16', `And on the other end of the spectrum,`],
    ['02:17', `there's also the happiness of excellence,`],
    ['02:20', `the happiness of always doing your best.`],
    ['02:23', `So for some people happiness means,`],
    ['02:25', `“Okay, I live a life doing my best.”`],
    ['02:27', `But for other people, happiness can mean`],
    ['02:29', `“I'm going to take the easy route`],
    ['02:30', `because I want to be lazy, I want to chill.”`],
    ['02:32', `So that's why I think happiness is too broad a term to tell people to chase after.`],
    ['02:37', `Rather, when you tell yourself,`],
    ['02:38', `“I want to live a life that I'm proud of,`],
    ['02:40', `I want to do things that I'm proud of,”`],
    ['02:42', `that pushes you just a little bit further than if you told yourself,`],
    ['02:46', `“I want to live a life that makes me happy.”`],
    ['02:48', `The second lesson I learned at lately is`],
    ['02:50', `to close the gap between “knowing” and “doing”.`],
    ['02:54', `Confidence comes from knowing.`],
    ['02:57', `So what I'm talking about is *knowing* what you have to do vs. actually *doing* it.`],
    ['03:02', `So the greater the gap between those two things,`],
    ['03:05', `the greater the discomfort, the greater the anguish,`],
    ['03:08', `the greater the resistance, procrastination.`],
    ['03:11', `And then you have all this stress`],
    ['03:12', `and feeling overwhelmed and feeling anxious in between.`],
    ['03:16', `So you want to take action immediately, once you know enough information.`],
    ['03:20', `And on one hand this might seem obvious, like`],
    ['03:23', `“Don't procrastinate, take action, blah, blah, blah.”`],
    ['03:25', `But the secret to closing that gap is finding out what you need to know.`],
    ['03:31', `Confidence comes from knowing.`],
    ['03:33', `So a lot of times people get stuck between that gap`],
    ['03:37', `because they don't know enough to take the leap and start doing.`],
    ['03:41', `They know a little bit.`],
    ['03:42', `They know what they think they have to do.`],
    ['03:43', `And maybe you don't have enough research`],
    ['03:45', `or enough data or maybe you're just afraid.`],
    ['03:48', `And it's likely that you're scared`],
    ['03:50', `because there's so much uncertainty in that gap, in that area.`],
    ['03:54', `You're not sure how to approach this action that you have to do.`],
    ['03:57', `You're not sure how to figure out this project.`],
    ['03:59', `You're not sure which way to take.`],
    ['04:01', `And there's just a lot of “I don't know’s”.`],
    ['04:03', `So what you can do is list out what you know for sure`],
    ['04:07', `and then list out what are the things that you don't know`],
    ['04:10', `that you need to find out, that would help you get closer`],
    ['04:14', `to taking action without being afraid.`],
    ['04:16', `The more that you find out, the more knowledge you gather,`],
    ['04:18', `the more confident that you're going to become,`],
    ['04:21', `because you're going to figure out how to do things.`],
    ['04:23', `If you're stuck between wanting to start a business,`],
    ['04:26', `but you just don't know how to start,`],
    ['04:28', `you need to go out and research.`],
    ['04:29', `You need to go find the tools,`],
    ['04:31', `learn how to make a website, learn how to take photos –`],
    ['04:35', `basically, gather the knowledge that would help you`],
    ['04:37', `make better decisions and be better at your craft.`],
    ['04:41', `And sometimes it's just a matter of putting effort into`],
    ['04:44', `practicing and practicing until you get better.`],
    ['04:47', `And once you get better, then you become more confident.`],
    ['04:49', `So you're less scared to procrastinate.`],
    ['04:51', `To put this in another way, a lot of the times,`],
    ['04:53', `what hold you back from taking an action on a project,`],
    ['04:56', `is because it matters so much to you that you're afraid to start`],
    ['05:00', `because you're afraid to mess it up.`],
    ['05:02', `You're afraid to fail.`],
    ['05:04', `And so you need to gain confidence in yourself and your abilities`],
    ['05:08', `in order to be able to take action without feeling scared,`],
    ['05:12', `without that procrastination or resistance.`],
    ['05:14', `And that can come from two things.`],
    ['05:16', `#1 is gathering information:`],
    ['05:18', `learning, gathering all the knowledge that you need, learning the skills.`],
    ['05:22', `And then #2 is just practicing and doing it and doing it until you get better at it.`],
    ['05:27', `And the better you are, the more confident you are,`],
    ['05:29', `and the less you're going to want to procrastinate`],
    ['05:32', `because you know how to do it.`],
    ['05:34', `You believe in yourself to do it.`],
    ['05:36', `So just the idea of closing that gap between knowing and doing`],
    ['05:41', `will help you so much because the greater the gap,`],
    ['05:44', `the greater the discomfort.`],
    ['05:46', `That area of discomfort is where your mind`],
    ['05:49', `just overthinks, overanalyzes, stresses out, worries.`],
    ['05:53', `It feels anxious and you're just not putting it to good use.`],
    ['05:58', `And on the topic of building your knowledge, skills, and confidence,`],
    ['06:01', `I want to thank Skillshare for sponsoring today's video.`],
    ['06:04', `Skillshare is a perfect example of a place you can go`],
    ['06:08', `to learn new skills, gather the knowledge that you need to get`],
    ['06:12', `in order to give yourself more confidence to take action towards your goals.`],
    ['06:16', `Skillshare is an online learning community`],
    ['06:18', `with thousands of classes covering dozens of creative and entrepreneurial skills.`],
    ['06:23', `Premium membership gives you unlimited access`],
    ['06:26', `so you can join the classes and communities that are just right for you.`],
    ['06:29', `Whether you want to fuel your curiosity, creativity, or even career,`],
    ['06:33', `Skillshare is the perfect place to keep you learning and creating.`],
    ['06:36', `If you are a creative or entrepreneur,`],
    ['06:38', `a class that I think you'd really like is this one`],
    ['06:40', `on personal branding and crafting your social media presence.`],
    ['06:43', `This class helps you find your purpose for your brand`],
    ['06:45', `and how to figure out what type of content to create.`],
    ['06:48', `By the way, Skillshare is also really affordable,`],
    ['06:50', `especially when compared to pricey in-person classes and workshops.`],
    ['06:55', `An annual subscription is less than $10 a month.`],
    ['06:58', `Because Skillshare is sponsoring this video,`],
    ['07:00', `you can get a two month free trial by signing up`],
    ['07:02', `down below at that link in the description.`],
    ['07:04', `The next lesson I learned recently is:`],
    ['07:05', `You have to seek first to understand people.`],
    ['07:09', `People have such different worldviews`],
    ['07:11', `because we are raised in a different environment with different circumstances.`],
    ['07:15', `Everyone has their own conditioning`],
    ['07:17', `and you might not realize your condition,`],
    ['07:20', `but you are biased in your worldview.`],
    ['07:22', `You only know the world through what you've seen,`],
    ['07:25', `through what you've experienced,`],
    ['07:27', `and someone else can have a completely different experience of the world`],
    ['07:31', `and thus a completely different worldview as you.`],
    ['07:34', `And I think the problem with all of our different experiences is`],
    ['07:38', `we can't understand each other because we are so different.`],
    ['07:42', `And so you have to seek to understand those people`],
    ['07:45', `who are very, very different from you, like in politics.`],
    ['07:48', `You know, people on the other end of the spectrum,`],
    ['07:50', `why do they think what they think?`],
    ['07:52', `Why do they believe what they believe?`],
    ['07:54', `And you have to respect their beliefs and understand.`],
    ['07:58', `Try to understand where that comes from.`],
    ['08:00', `You know, being raised Asian-American in California,`],
    ['08:03', `I totally have my biases.`],
    ['08:04', `You know, we're more progressive here`],
    ['08:06', `and you see the world in a certain way.`],
    ['08:09', `We're more health conscious.`],
    ['08:10', `The things we eat are different than what other people eat around the world.`],
    ['08:14', `It's so important to recognize that your world view is limited`],
    ['08:18', `and it's not the only way.`],
    ['08:20', `It's not the best way.`],
    ['08:21', `There are so many other perspectives and options out there.`],
    ['08:24', `So it's best to go out there, talk to people,`],
    ['08:26', `and really, really try to understand different perspectives.`],
    ['08:30', `And that's the beauty of our world,`],
    ['08:33', `is that we have people from all walks of life, all different perspectives.`],
    ['08:37', `We feel such a wide spectrum`],
    ['08:38', `and everyone is meant to bring something to the table.`],
    ['08:42', `So you can't work together if you don't understand each other`],
    ['08:45', `and if you don't communicate with each other.`],
    ['08:47', `So the first step is to just recognize we're all different,`],
    ['08:50', `but we can understand each other and work together.`],
    ['08:53', `The fourth lesson that I want to is`],
    ['08:55', `something that I've learned over and over again,`],
    ['08:57', `and I feel like with relationships and friendships,`],
    ['08:59', `you learn it more and more on a deeper level.`],
    ['09:02', `You have to learn to treat people the way that they want to be treated,`],
    ['09:06', `not how you want to be treated, because people are different.`],
    ['09:11', `So you have to understand people so deeply`],
    ['09:13', `that you know what they would want,`],
    ['09:15', `not what you would want, because everyone's different.`],
    ['09:19', `You can't expect that they want the same thing that you want.`],
    ['09:21', `And I don't know if you guys have heard of the Five Love Languages.`],
    ['09:25', `That is a really good place to start.`],
    ['09:27', `That's the idea that there are different love languages,`],
    ['09:29', `and everyone speaks and appreciates different languages.`],
    ['09:33', `So if you have a partner and you speak different languages,`],
    ['09:36', `you could be expressing your love in the way`],
    ['09:39', `that you feel is the way that is natural to you,`],
    ['09:43', `and they might not be able to receive that love,`],
    ['09:45', `and they might express their love in a different way`],
    ['09:47', `that doesn't resonate with you.`],
    ['09:50', `And so you have to first understand those differences.`],
    ['09:53', `And then you can learn to speak their language`],
    ['09:54', `and they can learn to speak your language.`],
    ['09:56', `And that is the first step.`],
    ['09:58', `By the way, I'll link my video on the five love languages down below so you can learn more.`],
    ['10:02', `But even aside from the five love languages,`],
    ['10:05', `people have different motivations,`],
    ['10:07', `different things that trigger their motivations.`],
    ['10:11', `For some people you have to be harder on them.`],
    ['10:13', `For some people you have to be more gentle with them.`],
    ['10:15', `Some people are motivated when you don't believe in them.`],
    ['10:19', `They're motivated when you doubt them,`],
    ['10:20', `like “You can't do this, you can't do that.”`],
    ['10:22', `And then other people, if you doubt them`],
    ['10:24', `and you don't believe in them, it crushes them.`],
    ['10:27', `And for those people, you have to really nurture them`],
    ['10:30', `and be gentle and push them in a very encouraging, loving, positive way.`],
    ['10:35', `And the funny thing is, Wilson is the first and I am the latter.`],
    ['10:38', `I need support.`],
    ['10:39', `I need people to believe in me.`],
    ['10:41', `And he, no matter how much I tried to verbally tell him`],
    ['10:45', `I believe in him and push him in a nice way,`],
    ['10:47', `it does not work for him,`],
    ['10:48', `and he needs someone to be straight and mean`],
    ['10:52', `and rough and pushing with him.`],
    ['10:54', `Basically, different things trigger different people.`],
    ['10:57', `And so you have to understand people and give them what they need.`],
    ['11:02', `There's also a concept called “emotional withdrawals”`],
    ['11:04', `and “emotional deposits” in relationships.`],
    ['11:08', `So just like a bank has withdrawals and deposits,`],
    ['11:10', `in relationships, there's the same thing with emotions.`],
    ['11:14', `A withdrawal is something that takes away energy,`],
    ['11:17', `and a deposit is something that gives love and energy.`],
    ['11:21', `So sometimes you have to take away your energy`],
    ['11:25', `to deposit in someone else's, like:`],
    ['11:26', `You don't want to go to someone's soccer game,`],
    ['11:31', `but you want to do it because you love them.`],
    ['11:33', `And so you withdraw from your own emotion and you deposit in theirs.`],
    ['11:38', `And so there are certain things that are withdrawals or deposits,`],
    ['11:41', `and it's different for everyone.`],
    ['11:43', `For example, I love to travel and I would love to go anywhere.`],
    ['11:47', `If Wilson had a work trip, I would go and I would think it's fun.`],
    ['11:49', `For me, that's an emotional deposit`],
    ['11:51', `because I see it as we're spending time together and it's good.`],
    ['11:56', `I feel good doing that.`],
    ['11:58', `But on the other hand, he does not like going on work trips with me.`],
    ['12:02', `He doesn't like that I travel so much.`],
    ['12:04', `It takes a lot of energy out of him if he has to go with me somewhere.`],
    ['12:08', `And so it's an emotional withdrawal for him.`],
    ['12:11', `So you have to understand that people are different.`],
    ['12:13', `We have different withdrawals and deposits,`],
    ['12:15', `and it's one of those things that you learn over time through experience.`],
    ['12:20', `What is a withdrawal or what is a deposit?`],
    ['12:23', `And the more you learn, the better you can be in your relationships.`],
    ['12:26', `The next lesson I learned recently is the power of teamwork.`],
    ['12:30', `And it might sound basic to you, but really,`],
    ['12:33', `doing things by yourself vs. doing it with a team.`],
    ['12:37', `There's pros and cons to both,`],
    ['12:38', `but you can do so much more with other people when you collaborate,`],
    ['12:42', `when you bring your strengths to the table together.`],
    ['12:47', `I love this quote: “If you want to go fast, go alone.`],
    ['12:51', `If you want to go far, go together.”`],
    ['12:53', `And I feel like these past two years with Lavendaire,`],
    ['12:56', `I've been learning to be slower and be patient`],
    ['13:00', `because I'm working with a small team`],
    ['13:01', `and things take longer when you're working with multiple people.`],
    ['13:04', `It takes longer to communicate between people`],
    ['13:08', `to communicate ideas and your vision and to work things out.`],
    ['13:13', `Previously I did everything myself`],
    ['13:14', `and when you're doing everything yourself, it's really fast.`],
    ['13:16', `You know what you want, you just do it, whatever.`],
    ['13:19', `But I'm learning to delegate more`],
    ['13:22', `and I see the power of working with people, collaborating.`],
    ['13:27', `And I was just thinking the other day –`],
    ['13:28', `you know how we're coming out with the new`],
    ['13:30', `Pastel Notebooks and the Artist of Life Workbook.`],
    ['13:32', `I realized how many people it takes to launch a product`],
    ['13:37', `and get it in the hands of you guys.`],
    ['13:39', `It's not just me anymore.`],
    ['13:41', `The first version of the workbook, I just made it myself.`],
    ['13:44', `It was a digital PDF.`],
    ['13:45', `I sent it directly.`],
    ['13:46', `You guys purchased it, downloaded it.`],
    ['13:48', `It was really easy.`],
    ['13:49', `Now with a physical product, you have the factory,`],
    ['13:53', `the manufacturing team, and then you have the sourcing team in China,`],
    ['13:56', `two people that I WeChat with,`],
    ['13:58', `and then we have Wilson's team, his partner,`],
    ['14:01', `his employees, the warehouse workers,`],
    ['14:03', `people packing and shipping these things.`],
    ['14:06', `We have the postal service, people literally shipping things.`],
    ['14:10', `And then you have the Lavendaire team.`],
    ['14:11', `You have me, you have my assistant.`],
    ['14:13', `I have an editor, a graphic designer, photographer,`],
    ['14:16', `when I hire photographers for my photo shoots.`],
    ['14:19', `There's a whole chain here.`],
    ['14:21', `And if any one in that group of people messes up,`],
    ['14:25', `it kind of affects the rest of the chain.`],
    ['14:28', `And so the more people you work with,`],
    ['14:30', `the more room there is for error`],
    ['14:32', `and a lot of things are outside of your control`],
    ['14:35', `and things take a lot slower.`],
    ['14:37', `And it's just just a bigger scale that I am learning to work with,`],
