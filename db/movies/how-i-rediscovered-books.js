    ['00:00', `Tell me if you can relate to this.`],
    ['00:01', `You were an avid reader of fiction as a kid.`],
    ['00:04', `The Harry Potter series, The Hunger Games,`],
    ['00:07', `Bobby Pendragon, Percy Jackson`],
    ['00:09', `You ate them like ice cream,`],
    ['00:11', `you drank them like water in summertime after running around at the park.`],
    ['00:14', `You would spend hours in your bedroom, in another world, in another universe.`],
    ['00:25', `I was one of those kids.`],
    ['00:26', `That was my experience growing up.`],
    ['00:28', `But somewhere along the line, like early teenage years, that all ended.`],
    ['00:32', `I'm not sure it's a coincidence that I got my first smartphone when I was 14 years old.`],
    ['00:37', `Suddenly there were a lot of other things capturing my attention,`],
    ['00:39', `you know, better things to do.`],
    ['00:41', `I feel like many of us who are now in our 20s and 30s went through this.`],
    ['00:44', `I mean, I went years without reading anything outside of what I was required to read at school.`],
    ['00:49', `Last year, though,`],
    ['00:50', `I rediscovered books, and now they are my very favorite way to absorb new information.`],
    ['00:58', `I honestly think that every single book I have ever read`],
    ['01:01', `has changed me and my perspective of the world in some way.`],
    ['01:07', `Books are incredible in the sense that they are`],
    ['01:10', `usually thousands or many thousands of hours of work,`],
    ['01:14', `and energy, and knowledge, condensed into a few hundred pages.`],
    ['01:18', `The author is imparting in you a piece of their lives,`],
    ['01:23', `of what they know, or their imagination.`],
    ['01:26', `A part of them, basically.`],
    ['01:27', `It's actually a beautiful concept if you think about it.`],
    ['01:29', `I have a few book recommendations, but I'm gonna save that for the second half of this video.`],
    ['01:34', `And, like I said before,`],
    ['01:35', `reading transports you to another place.`],
    ['01:37', `And I used to think that was exclusive to fiction,`],
    ['01:39', `but that's not true at all.`],
    ['01:40', `Like I said, it was only recently, last summer actually,`],
    ['01:43', `that I rediscovered books through my smartphone, actually. Believe it or not.`],
    ['01:46', `Things always go full circle. It's amazing`],
    ['01:49', `I mainly listen to them in the morning when I go running,`],
    ['01:51', `when I'm cooking, or before I go to bed.`],
    ['01:53', `But they're also wonderful to listen to when you're exploring the city,`],
    ['01:57', `or you know, when I'm coloring footage.`],
    ['01:59', `I think I was really hungry for new perspectives and insights on life.`],
    ['02:03', `And now I'm just trying to make up for lost time because there's just something amazing about books,`],
    ['02:08', `and how they're able to expand your mind and perspective.`],
    ['02:11', `I think it's fair to say there isn't another medium that can go deeper on a topic.`],
    ['02:16', `Honestly, for much of the last decade`],
    ['02:19', `I thought libraries were extremely boring places,`],
    ['02:22', `and my opinion of bookstores was only slightly better.`],
    ['02:26', `I just think circumstances played a big role.`],
    ['02:28', `I felt forced to be there,`],
    ['02:30', `for school projects for example,`],
    ['02:32', `Maybe I was just a spazzy teenager, but you know what?`],
    ['02:35', `I've realized that not all bookstores and libraries were created equal.`],
    ['02:39', `So, I decided to take a trip to "La Biblioteca Vasconcelos"`],
    ['02:43', `here in Mexico City.`],
    ['02:44', `It's pretty well known here`],
    ['02:45', `and you're about to find out why.`],
    ['02:51', `All right, that's the building right there.`],
    ['02:54', `It's pretty big.`],
    ['02:57', `Holy smokes!`],
    ['03:05', `Oh my god!`],
    ['03:08', `This is craziness! Look at this!`],
    ['03:12', `Look at that!`],
    ['03:14', `Oh my God!`],
    ['03:16', `I'm like in shock right now, this is insane!`],
    ['03:18', `Don't focus on me.`],
    ['03:20', `All right. I'm just gonna 'skedaddle' out of the frame.`],
    ['03:22', `See you guys later.`],
    ['03:24', `God! It continues!`],
    ['03:26', `Check this out. I came from over there.`],
    ['03:29', `That's like where I entered. It continues on this side.`],
    ['03:33', `I must seem like such a typical American right now,`],
    ['03:36', `just blown away by everything.`],
    ['03:40', `This is kind of a random anecdote, but I remember the first time I read an entire book in French.`],
    ['03:46', `I had to look up every other word.`],
    ['03:47', `It was a major struggle, but I did it and it was a huge milestone for me.`],
    ['03:52', `Mainly at this stage of my life,`],
    ['03:54', `I'm consuming self-help books,`],
    ['03:56', `or work on psychology and spirituality,`],
    ['03:58', `and it's almost entirely audiobooks.`],
    ['04:00', `But the point I'm trying to make here, is there's no right way to do it.`],
    ['04:04', `What matters is that books are, in some way, a part of your life.`],
    ['04:11', `Learning new things has helped me with depression.`],
    ['04:14', `It's helped me with loneliness.`],
    ['04:16', `It's like it opens new doors when you think there's just no point.`],
    ['04:20', `It has never failed to give me even just a little bit of purpose`],
    ['04:24', `in times when I have felt absolutely no sense of direction.`],
    ['04:28', `Also, you're looking at the work of many thousands of human beings.`],
    ['04:33', `Doesn't that restore your faith in humanity a little bit?`],
    ['04:36', `Look at what we're capable of.`],
    ['04:40', `My pieces are littered with book recommendations, but I want this to be different.`],
    ['04:45', `I want to spark that same`],
    ['04:46', `excitement and joy that I feel when I'm consuming a book, in you.`],
    ['04:50', `So I'm gonna make this kind of like a visual and auditory experience.`],
    ['04:54', `I want to share what I felt when I was listening to four books in particular.`],
    ['04:59', `Mmm-hmm. Here we go.`],
    ['05:01', `"Sapiens"`],
    ['05:03', `This book is a masterpiece.`],
    ['05:05', `Nothing I've ever read has so greatly shifted my perspective on humanity.`],
    ['05:10', `Listening to the sweeping prose`],
    ['05:12', `on the origins and evolution of our race on this earth felt like I left my body`],
    ['05:16', `and floated above the clouds.`],
    ['05:18', `From there,`],
    ['05:19', `I watched thousands of years unfold.`],
    ['05:21', `As our ancestors experienced all of the evolving wonders and horrors of what it meant to be a human.`],
    ['05:29', `Something about this book just made things click for me.`],
    ['05:32', `How and why we operate and interact the way that we do.`],
    ['05:36', `The origins of tribalism, religion, and money,`],
    ['05:39', `and how these things exist in our world today.`],
    ['05:42', `I find these insights useful in my day to day life actually.`],
    ['05:44', `They kind of inform many of my decisions, and how I interpret what occurs around me.`],
    ['05:51', `"Essentialism"`],
    ['05:53', `In a very confusing world where my options are now practically infinite,`],
    ['05:56', `and everyone is battling for my time and attention,`],
    ['05:59', `I needed an operating system with which to live life.`],
    ['06:03', `Many times while I was growing up I felt like I was drowning,`],
    ['06:06', `never able to keep up while everything flew right by.`],
    ['06:11', `This book feels like the guide on how to handle it all.`],
    ['06:14', `Greg McKeown defines essentialism as "The disciplined pursuit of less, but better".`],
    ['06:20', `When I began listening to this book`],
    ['06:21', `I had the strange feeling that someone was describing the path that I'm already on.`],
    ['06:25', `Like flashing a light down a dark tunnel that you're crawling through.`],
    ['06:28', `I could immediately see where I was headed.`],
    ['06:31', `Just felt real it felt like a relief.`],
    ['06:34', `It felt like clarity on how to act and what to do.`],
    ['06:37', `One review of this piece summed things up delightfully:`],
    ['06:41', `"Less is more. It's also less. That's the point."`],
    ['06:45', `I can't think of a single person that wouldn't benefit immensely from this piece, this way of life.`],
    ['06:51', `"The Dip"`],
    ['06:53', `Seth Godin is such a talented writer that several of his books could have ended up on here.`],
    ['06:59', `I picked this one because it's incredibly short and yet it was incredibly impactful for me in my career.`],
    ['07:05', `"Quitting" for me has always been an ugly word.`],
    ['07:09', `I usually stick with things until the bitter end,`],
    ['07:11', `but this book really showed me that knowing when to quit can be an incredible skill.`],
    ['07:17', `As he said it: "Quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers."`],
    ['07:21', `I listened to this while driving through the Oregon countryside`],
    ['07:24', `at the very beginning of this year.`],
    ['07:26', `Wondering if posting these videos online was going to work out for me.`],
    ['07:29', `All I can say is: "Seth, you're the man"`],
    ['07:34', `"Jonathan Livingston Seagull"`],
    ['07:36', `This is one of the very few books I've ever read multiple times throughout my life.`],
    ['07:41', `It's very simple.`],
    ['07:42', `I think that's why I like it so much.`],
    ['07:44', `This book is definitely not for everybody,`],
    ['07:47', `and I do believe that it requires an open mind.`],
    ['07:49', `But for those that can connect with the story,`],
    ['07:53', `I feel like it has a lasting impact.`],
    ['07:55', `It's the story of Jonathan,`],
    ['07:57', `the seagull that is unsatisfied with just learning how to fly.`],
    ['08:00', `This is a bird with an intense desire to learn and to push limits and boundaries.`],
    ['08:05', `This book is about his journey, the stages he goes through,`],
    ['08:08', `the obstacles that he faces.`],
    ['08:11', `I almost don't want to say anything else about it.`],
    ['08:13', `Maybe because I don't want to give the wrong idea or to elevate expectations.`],
    ['08:18', `You could almost call this a children's book.`],
    ['08:21', `You can easily read it in one sitting,`],
    ['08:22', `but trust me when I say that it will live in your mind for far longer than that.`],
    ['08:27', `Just a final note about it:`],
    ['08:28', `I highly recommend actually reading this one,`],
    ['08:31', `rather than listening to it and to get the older version,`],
    ['08:33', `which I have linked to down below.`],
    ['08:35', `Both the newer version and the audio version really kill some of the magic`],
    ['08:39', `by adding things that aren't needed.`],
    ['08:41', `The original was perfect as it was, in my opinion.`],
    ['08:49', `I hope that this moved you in some way.`],
    ['08:52', `I guess this is sort of a way for me to express my gratitude to the authors of these books.`],
    ['08:56', `Whatever you do, if books are not currently a part of your life, try to bring them back.`],
    ['09:01', `They will change you.`],
    ['09:02', `There's a link to a free 30-day trial with Audible in the description below,`],
    ['09:07', `which basically means that you could try the first book at no cost at all.`],
    ['09:11', `If it doesn't work for you,`],
    ['09:12', `you know, audiobooks isn't your thing,`],
    ['09:14', `or you don't like one of the titles, that's totally cool.`],
    ['09:16', `You know, it's not for everybody.`],
    ['09:17', `But all I'm saying is give it a shot.`],
    ['09:19', `And if you're interested I will be sending out more book recommendations via my newsletter,`],
    ['09:24', `so, you can sign up to that also in the description down below.`],
    ['09:27', `Finally you can help keep this project going by supporting me on Patreon,`],
    ['09:31', `where I upload exclusive and bonus content,`],
    ['09:34', `and you can also follow my progress on Instagram.`],
    ['09:36', `Thank you guys so much for watching, and you know for being a part of this whole thing.`],
    ['09:40', `I feel incredibly lucky to have you guys on this ride with me.`],
    ['09:44', `So...`],
    ['09:45', `See you soon!`]
