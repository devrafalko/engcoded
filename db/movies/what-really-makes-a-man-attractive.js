    ['06:12', `guys out there you just don't have good manners. I mean there's been a lot of`],

    ['07:39', `share my deep feelings with her and it made a connection with me and her that`],
    ['07:45', `just made our bond so much stronger. It's interesting that studies also showed`],
    ['07:50', `that when men are vulnerable women find them more desirable both emotionally and`],
    ['07:56', `sexually. Why? Because it allows them to connect with you on a deeper level and they`],
    ['08:03', `cannot connect with men who are closed off and don't want to talk about their`],
    ['08:07', `emotions. If you liked the video give it a thumbs up subscribe and we will talk`],
