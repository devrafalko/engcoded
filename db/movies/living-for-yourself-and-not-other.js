    ['00:04', `Hey guys!`],
    ['00:05', `So today I want to talk about living for yourself and not others`],
    ['00:09', `and I am going to get ready with you.`],
    ['00:12', `It's been a long time since I've done a "get ready with me",`],
    ['00:15', `sit down and chit chat kind of thing.`],
    ['00:17', `So for some random reason I felt like doing it for this video.`],
    ['00:20', `So I'm going to start with priming my face.`],
    ['00:23', `This is just a spray primer by Too Faced.`],
    ['00:30', `I don't even know if I did that right.`],
    ['00:31', `I don't know for a primer, are you supposed to wipe it in`],
    ['00:33', `or are you supposed to let it dry?`],
    ['00:34', `But I do this.`],
    ['00:37', `Let me clip up these guys.`],
    ['00:41', `Oh my god, it matches.`],
    ['00:42', `So I'm gonna move on to foundation.`],
    ['00:44', `This is by Hourglass, and as I'm putting on the foundation on my face,`],
    ['00:49', `I want to just, I guess revisit the foundation of Lavendaire.`],
    ['00:53', `I mean this whole channel is about how to learn`],
    ['00:57', `to create your dream life, be an artist of life.`],
    ['00:59', `So as I was saying, the foundation of Lavendaire is learning`],
    ['01:02', `how to become a really amazing artist of life.`],
    ['01:06', `And a big part of that is learning to live for yourself and not others.`],
    ['01:11', `And when I say live for yourself and not others,`],
    ['01:14', `I mean living a life that you want to live`],
    ['01:17', `a life that you love, a life that you enjoy,`],
    ['01:19', `a life that you are proud of.`],
    ['01:21', `Living for others means you’re setting your goals`],
    ['01:25', `based on what others want for you, like your parents.`],
    ['01:28', `Or maybe you feel like you want to fit into society's mold`],
    ['01:32', `in terms of like what looks successful to other people.`],
    ['01:35', `Living for others can also mean wanting to do things to impress others,`],
    ['01:40', `to please others, to get approval from others`],
    ['01:43', `so you're not really being your true authentic self and doing what you want.`],
    ['01:48', `You're doing things because you care about how you appear to others.`],
    ['01:52', `Okay, so now I'm putting on concealer just a bit.`],
    ['01:55', `This one is my favorite concealer by Tarte.`],
    ['01:58', `So learning to live for yourself is all about setting your own standards`],
    ['02:02', `for what you deem a happy and successful and beautiful life.`],
    ['02:06', `It's really up to you and everyone is different.`],
    ['02:09', `So you really have to know yourself first.`],
    ['02:12', `Know yourself, know what you want –`],
    ['02:14', `and sometimes you don't know what you want`],
    ['02:16', `until you go out and explore, experience it, and then, you know.`],
    ['02:20', `I started reading this book last night called`],
    ['02:22', `“101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think” by Brianna West.`],
    ['02:26', `And one of the things she said in the first few chapters was:`],
    ['02:30', `You can't predict what's going to make you happy`],
    ['02:33', `because everything your brain knows is from past experience.`],
    ['02:37', `So anything that you haven't experienced,`],
    ['02:39', `you don't know whether it will make you happy or not.`],
    ['02:42', `So everything that you think will make you happy is just based on the past.`],
    ['02:46', `There could be so many other things in the world that will make you happy.`],
    ['02:49', `So many opportunities and experiences`],
    ['02:52', `and you will never know unless you go out there and try it.`],
    ['02:55', `I think a really important thing when you're young is to go out there`],
    ['02:59', `and meet people, explore, open up your world and your perspective first`],
    ['03:04', `in order to see what's possible for you.`],
    ['03:07', `And then you can decide, you know, what would be a happy life for you.`],
    ['03:11', `All right, so now I'm moving on to eye makeup.`],
    ['03:13', `I have this palette by BH Cosmetics.`],
    ['03:16', `It is Sylvia Gani’s palette with BH,`],
    ['03:19', `and today I'm going to do an orange-y yellow-y, summery look`],
    ['03:24', `because look at me, I'm all lemon-ed out right now,`],
    ['03:27', `So I'm going to do Wolf first and then I'll move on to Chanel`],
    ['03:30', `and then Ginger, maybe throw in a little Goddess for some golden shimmer.`],
    ['03:35', `So last night during a journaling session`],
    ['03:37', `I kind of reframed my thinking on living for yourself.`],
    ['03:41', `I think previously I was focused on creating a life that I love,`],
    ['03:45', `creating a life where I am happy,`],
    ['03:46', `where I'm doing something I'm passionate about,`],
    ['03:48', `which all are great things.`],
    ['03:50', `There's nothing wrong with that,`],
    ['03:51', `but I think there was something else that needed to be added into the equation`],
    ['03:56', `because I've had this, I guess up-and-down of motivation.`],
    ['04:02', `And I heard from this book that I was listening to –`],
    ['04:05', `“The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” –`],
    ['04:07', `that satisfied needs do not motivate.`],
    ['04:11', `What that means is: Once you have satisfied a need,`],
    ['04:14', `it doesn't motivate you anymore.`],
    ['04:16', `And I feel like I've satisfied a lot of my needs,`],
    ['04:19', `a lot of my previous goals, like building a career that I love,`],
    ['04:24', `like doing something that is meaningful and impactful`],
    ['04:27', `and I feel like I'm doing all of that.`],
    ['04:29', `And so it does not necessarily continue to motivate me`],
    ['04:33', `because I'm already doing it, I already have it.`],
    ['04:36', `So I need to figure out a way to motivate myself to keep going.`],
    ['04:42', `I had to reframe my thinking and so I asked myself,`],
    ['04:44', `“Okay, what motivates me?”`],
    ['04:46', `And I always like go back to these ideas that,`],
    ['04:50', `I'm motivated when I'm creating work that I'm proud of.`],
    ['04:53', `I'm motivated when I'm living a life that I'm proud of.`],
    ['04:57', `So I have to ask myself, “Okay, what am I proud of?`],
    ['05:01', `What do I do that makes me proud?”`],
    ['05:04', `I think first – I think immediately to living aligned to your values.`],
    ['05:09', `So values of honesty, authenticity, integrity, creativity, kindness, compassion.`],
    ['05:16', `Those are things that really matter to me.`],
    ['05:18', `And so I feel proud of myself when I live aligned to all those values that I set for myself.`],
    ['05:24', `Another part of what makes me proud is when I step out of my comfort zone.`],
    ['05:29', `When I decide to do something different,`],
    ['05:30', `when I experiment and try something new,`],
    ['05:33', `something that scares me and that's when I'm proud of myself`],
    ['05:37', `because I stretched myself, I did that.`],
    ['05:40', `And then I started listing all the detailed examples`],
    ['05:43', `of things that I could do that I would be proud of myself for`],
    ['05:47', `and a lot of those things are simple daily actions.`],
    ['05:51', `I'm proud of myself if I meditate every day, if I journal every day,`],
    ['05:55', `if I floss every day because I don't floss every day`],
    ['05:57', `and if I do it, I'm like, “Oh, I'm proud of myself. I did that."`],
    ['06:01', `and I realized that I've been putting a lot of these`],
    ['06:04', `menial things off, things like chores.`],
    ['06:07', `I'm really bad at chores and admin stuff`],
    ['06:09', `like folding laundry right after I do it or putting away things.`],
    ['06:13', `I'm not really – I haven't really been that organized lately.`],
    ['06:16', `I know I used to be more organized.`],
    ['06:18', `I went through the whole KonMari thing and lately`],
    ['06:21', `I've just been focused on my career, my happiness,`],
    ['06:24', `that all of these like minuscule things`],
    ['06:27', `that didn't seem like they mattered, I put to the side.`],
    ['06:30', `I realized that it's because folding clothes doesn't necessarily make me happy`],
    ['06:35', `if I'm not passionate about it.`],
    ['06:36', `But these things need to get done and so I would be proud of myself`],
    ['06:41', `if I was more responsible in washing the dishes right away,`],
    ['06:45', `folding my clothes, doing these simple everyday things`],
    ['06:47', `that aren't necessarily fun but I'm proud of myself if I do it.`],
    ['06:52', `So that was a way to bring back all of these little things`],
    ['06:56', `that I've been putting off because I was so focused on happiness and passion.`],
    ['07:01', `And you know, because everything is important for a full life.`],
    ['07:06', `You need to like take care of yourself and also take care of your home, self care,`],
    ['07:11', `home care, life care, care about your relationships.`],
    ['07:14', `All of that is like really important for a full life, at least to me.`],
    ['07:17', `Basically I just asked myself,`],
    ['07:19', `“Okay, what are the important areas of my life?”`],
    ['07:23', `I think I tend to always put career first,`],
    ['07:25', `but there's other important areas too,`],
    ['07:27', `like family, friendships, relationships, health.`],
    ['07:31', `So just give yourself that journaling prompt:`],
    ['07:33', `“What could I do that would make me proud of myself?”`],
    ['07:37', `or “What constitutes a life that I'm proud of?”`],
    ['07:41', `And really like list out in detail all of the things`],
    ['07:43', `that would make you proud,`],
    ['07:45', `all the things that you would feel like, “Yes, I did that. I'm proud of myself,"`],
    ['07:50', `because ultimately going back to the living for yourself versus living for others,`],
    ['07:55', `living a life that you are proud of is living aligned to your values,`],
    ['08:00', `just living up to your own standards.`],
    ['08:02', `And that is self validation.`],
    ['08:05', `So when you live up to your own standards,`],
    ['08:08', `you cultivate self worth, self confidence.`],
    ['08:12', `You feel good about yourself.`],
    ['08:13', `It's not about like impressing others, it's just like doing it for yourself`],
    ['08:16', `because that's your standard,`],
    ['08:18', `that's your bar of what you think a full life looks like.`],
    ['08:23', `And so if you live according to that, then you'll feel good about yourself.`],
    ['08:26', `To finish up the eye, I am going to do some gold stuff in the inner corners.`],
    ['08:33', `I'm kind of doing a messy job because I'm talking while doing makeup.`],
    ['08:37', `I tend to love just being quiet while I'm doing this, but this is kind of fun too.`],
    ['08:42', `I get to practice using a different part of my brain.`],
    ['08:45', `Now I'm going to move on to eyeliner.`],
    ['08:47', `By the way, my favorite liner is still this EM Cosmetics brush tip one.`],
    ['08:51', `It's so good.`],
    ['08:53', `Also if you think about it, as you grow in life, your standards will grow as well.`],
    ['08:58', `So you're always going to have to continue pushing your comfort zone,`],
    ['09:02', `continue pushing your boundaries`],
    ['09:03', `and what constitutes a life that you're proud of.`],
    ['09:07', `In the past might not be what constitutes what you're proud of in the future.`],
    ['09:12', `For example, where I am right now is where I wanted to be`],
    ['09:16', `five years ago and this was my dream,`],
    ['09:19', `but I can't just hold onto the dream that I had five years ago.`],
    ['09:22', `I need to like keep pushing forward and look forward five years`],
    ['09:27', `and push towards that instead of just being proud of myself`],
    ['09:31', `and just staying where I am at right now.`],
    ['09:33', `You can't just like be content and stay where you are.`],
    ['09:36', `I mean the harsh truth that I do believe is:`],
    ['09:39', `You're either moving forward or you're moving backwards.`],
    ['09:42', `You're either going up or down.`],
    ['09:43', `There is no staying the same.`],
    ['09:45', `If you just get lazy with your habits,`],
    ['09:47', `you will start regressing and going backwards`],
    ['09:50', `so you always have to like keep pushing yourself forward`],
    ['09:53', `so that you can continue to be proud of yourself.`],
    ['09:56', `This is also to say that you cannot compare your standard`],
    ['09:59', `to someone else's standard to what a full successful life looks like.`],
    ['10:03', `Because you might be looking at someone who's super successful in your eyes`],
    ['10:06', `and you're thinking like, “Oh my God, they've made it.`],
    ['10:09', `They don't need to try anymore.`],
    ['10:10', `They've already like reached the goal.”`],
    ['10:12', `They're a movie star or whatever it is that they are.`],
    ['10:15', `But that person, the fact that they reached that point,`],
    ['10:18', `their standards have changed.`],
    ['10:20', `And in order for them to live a life that they're proud of,`],
    ['10:23', `they need to be continually pushing themselves and doing something different.`],
    ['10:27', `So there's no destination.`],
    ['10:30', `It really is about growth.`],
    ['10:32', `It's all about the process.`],
    ['10:33', `It's all about like how you expand throughout this process.`],
    ['10:37', `All right, so now I'm going to just put on some mascara.`],
    ['10:40', `This one is by NARS.`],
    ['10:41', `This one was gifted to me, but I actually really like it.`],
    ['10:45', `So I guess I'll put the bangs down now.`],
    ['10:46', `Oh no, this got stuck in my hair.`],
    ['10:49', `Oh no.`],
    ['10:52', `Let me fix this.`],
    ['10:54', `So I chose to do this orange-y look`],
    ['10:56', `because I really wanted to try this Serum Blush by EM.`],
    ['11:00', `This one's in “Sunset Sky” and this has been all over Instagram.`],
    ['11:03', `And I have just been so excited to use it.`],
    ['11:06', `It's basically like a liquid blush that is good for your skin,`],
    ['11:11', `like it's a serum and a blush together.`],
    ['11:12', `So I think you're supposed to like use it on your bare face,`],
    ['11:15', `but I'm sure you can use it with makeup too.`],
    ['11:17', `So it comes like this and you just pat it on your face, I guess.`],
    ['11:24', `So going back to that journal prompt on listing all the things`],
    ['11:27', `that you could do that would constitute a life that you're proud of.`],
    ['11:32', `The next step you can do is organize it into daily things, weekly things.`],
    ['11:38', `And then if you want, you can separate it into different categories`],
    ['11:41', `like Career, Relationships, or General.`],
    ['11:45', `I did this on Trello last night and I'll show you guys`],
    ['11:48', `a little snippet of what it kind of looks like.`],
    ['11:51', `And after you outline all the columns,`],
    ['11:54', `it kind of gives you a better picture of the daily habits`],
    ['11:59', `that you should do if you want to feel proud of yourself,`],
    ['12:01', `the weekly habits you should do,`],
    ['12:03', `if you want to feel proud of yourself`],
    ['12:04', `and things you should do with your career and everything else.`],
    ['12:07', `And then after writing everything, I made one more column at the end`],
    ['12:11', `and I wrote how would I feel if I were to do all these things,`],
    ['12:16', `living a life I'm proud of.`],
    ['12:18', `So then I just like listed all of the feelings that I would feel.`],
    ['12:22', `And I wrote it in present tense.`],
    ['12:23', `So I would feel happy because I'm living a life aligned to my values.`],
    ['12:28', `I would feel grateful, I would feel abundant.`],
    ['12:30', `I would feel important and valued.`],
    ['12:33', `I would feel worthy and confident in myself.`],
    ['12:36', `And the point of writing down all of those feelings`],
    ['12:38', `and writing them in the present tense is to utilize the law of attraction.`],
    ['12:42', `Because when you're manifesting what you desire,`],
    ['12:45', `you want to focus on the emotions,`],
    ['12:47', `how it feels to live that life that you want to live.`],
    ['12:50', `So the life that I want to live, put simply,`],
    ['12:52', `is the life that makes me proud of myself.`],
    ['12:56', `And all of the things that constitute that life, I wrote it down.`],
    ['13:00', `I broke it down and I wrote down all my values as well.`],
    ['13:04', `And then I focused on the feelings.`],
    ['13:06', `And I think I'm going to make an exercise`],
    ['13:08', `to read this Trello board every single day`],
    ['13:11', `and then spend at least five minutes, going through each feeling,`],
    ['13:14', `actually feeling it right now in my current state`],
    ['13:18', `because I think that will help attract and bring that reality to me.`],
    ['13:23', `And I mean it's only been one day –`],
    ['13:25', `it's only been today, but I feel really motivated.`],
    ['13:27', `I feel a lot more like just ready to do all those things.`],
    ['13:32', `And this morning I woke up and I decided to clean a little bit in my room`],
    ['13:36', `and I would normally be too lazy to do that.`],
    ['13:38', `But I wrote down on my Trello board that I would be proud of myself`],
    ['13:42', `if I kept my space clean and tidy and do all these little things`],
    ['13:47', `that don't really seem like they matter, but they really do matter.`],
    ['13:50', `Now I'm putting on this – I realize I'm using so many EM products today,`],
    ['13:56', `but it's because this lipstick came in the set with the blush.`],
    ['13:59', `So this is I believe “Faded Clementine” and they're like Lip Clouds.`],
    ['14:04', `It's also very orange-y.`],
    ['14:06', `I'm going to blend it out.`],
    ['14:08', `Okay, I think I'm done.`],
    ['14:10', `This is a simple summer-y look, very orange-y, coral-y, which I like.`],
    ['14:17', `But I hope you liked the talk today about learning to live for yourself,`],
    ['14:22', `not just a life that makes you happy, a life that you love,`],
    ['14:24', `but just a life that you are proud of`],
    ['14:26', `because when you focus on a life that you're proud of,`],
    ['14:30', `you force yourself to continue to push your comfort zone.`],
    ['14:34', `You force yourself to continue to grow because when you focus just on happiness –`],
    ['14:39', `I see happiness as in the present moment.`],
    ['14:42', `You can find happiness in any moment and that's really important too,`],
    ['14:47', `to just enjoy the present moment.`],
    ['14:49', `But if you want to continue to live a life that feels fulfilling,`],
    ['14:53', `a life that satisfies you, then you have to focus on`],
    ['14:57', `living a life that you're proud of and when you do things that you're proud of,`],
    ['15:01', `it's usually things that are not easy.`],
    ['15:03', `It's things that take a little more effort.`],
    ['15:06', `It's putting a little more effort into the work that you do,`],
    ['15:09', `a little more effort into putting on makeup or just a little more effort`],
    ['15:14', `so that you're not taking the easy route, the safe route,`],
    ['15:17', `and you're really pushing those boundaries.`],
    ['15:19', `You're really trying to live life to the fullest.`],
    ['15:22', `We always talk about like wanting to reach our full potential`],
    ['15:25', `and live life to the fullest.`],
    ['15:27', `But what that really means is that you can never stop growing.`],
    ['15:31', `You can't just like stay the same even if you've reached the goals that you've set for yourself.`],
    ['15:36', `Once you've reached those goals, there's always more to be experienced, more to explore.`],
    ['15:43', `Just don't stop, don't get content because you might feel content with your life for a while,`],
    ['15:49', `but if you don't do anything to improve,`],
    ['15:51', `then eventually that contentment is going to plateau`],
    ['15:55', `and then slow down, die down.`],
    ['15:57', `And really, to continue to live a fulfilling, meaningful life`],
    ['16:01', `means to continually push those boundaries,`],
    ['16:04', `continue to live aligned to your values as much as possible.`],
    ['16:11', `Keep doing those things that you don't really want to do,`],
    ['16:14', `but when you do it, you're proud of yourself.`],
