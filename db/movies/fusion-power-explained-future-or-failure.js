    ['00:42', `[Intro Jingle]`],
    ['00:49', `The sun shines because of nuclear fusion.`],
    ['00:51', `In a nutshell, fusion is a thermonuclear process.`],
    ['00:55', `Meaning that the ingredients have to be incredibly hot.`],
    ['00:57', `So hot, that the atoms are stripped of their electrons`],
    ['01:00', `Making a plasma where nuclei and electrons bounce around freely.`],
    ['01:05', `Since nuclei are all positively charged,`],
    ['01:08', `They repel each other.`],
    ['01:10', `In order to overcome this repulsion,`],
    ['01:11', `The particles have to be going very, very fast`],
    ['01:14', `In this context, very fast means "very hot"`],

    ['01:28', `Until they merge and fuse`],
    ['01:30', `Creating heavier nuclei and releasing energy in the process.`],
    ['01:35', `It is this energy release that scientists hope to harness`],
    ['01:38', `In a new generation of power plant,`],
    ['01:40', `The fusion reactor.`],
    ['01:42', `On earth it's not feasible to use this brute force method to create fusion.`],
    ['01:47', `So if we wanted to build a reactor that generates energy from fusion,`],
    ['01:51', `We have to get clever.`],
    ['01:53', `To date, scientists have invented two ways of making plasmas hot enough to fuse:`],
    ['01:58', `The first type of reactor uses a magnetic field to`],
    ['02:01', `Squeeze a plasma in a doughnut shaped chamber`],
    ['02:03', `Where the reactions take place.`],
    ['02:06', `These magnetic confinement reactors`],
    ['02:08', `Such as the I.T.E.R. reactor in France,`],
    ['02:11', `Use superconducting electromagnets cooled with liquid helium`],
    ['02:14', `To within a few degrees of absolute zero.`],
    ['02:17', `Meaning that they host some of the biggest temperature gradients in the known universe.`],
    ['02:22', `The second type called "Inertial confinement"`],
    ['02:24', `Uses pulses from super-powered lasers`],
    ['02:26', `To heat the surface of a pellet of fuel`],
    ['02:29', `Imploding it, briefly making the fuel hot and dense enough to fuse.`],
    ['02:33', `In fact, one of the of the most powerful lasers in the world`],
    ['02:36', `Is used for fusion experiments`],
    ['02:38', `At the National Ignition Facility in the U.S.`],
    ['02:41', `These experiments and others like them around the world`],
    ['02:44', `are today, just experiments.`],
    ['02:46', `Scientists are still developing the technology,`],
    ['02:50', `And although they can achieve fusion,`],
    ['02:52', `Right now, it costs more energy to do the experiment`],
    ['02:55', `Then they produce in fusion.`],
    ['02:58', `The technology has a long way to go before it's commercially viable,`],
    ['03:02', `and maybe it never will be.`],
    ['03:04', `It might just be impossible to make a viable fusion reactor on earth,`],
    ['03:09', `But if it gets there, it will be so efficient`],
    ['03:12', `That a single glass of sea water, could be used to produce`],
    ['03:15', `as much energy as burning a barrel of oil, with no waste to speak of.`],
    ['03:20', `This is because fusion reactors would use hydrogen or helium as fuel`],
    ['03:24', `And sea water is loaded with hydrogen`],
    ['03:27', `But not just any hydrogen will do.`],
    ['03:29', `Specific isotopes with extra neutrons called Deuterium and Tritium`],
    ['03:34', `Are needed to make the right reactions.`],
    ['03:36', `Deuterium is stable and can be found in abundance in sea water,`],
    ['03:40', `Though Tritium is a bit trickier.`],
    ['03:43', `It's radioactive`],
    ['03:44', `And there may only be 20 kilograms of it in the world`],
    ['03:47', `Mostly in nuclear warheads`],
    ['03:49', `Which makes it incredibly expensive.`],
    ['03:51', `So we made need another fusion buddy for Deuterium instead of Tritium.`],
    ['03:56', `Helium-3, an isotope of Helium, might be a great substitute.`],
    ['04:00', `Unfortunately, it's also incredibly rare on earth.`],
    ['04:04', `But here, the moon might have the answer.`],
    ['04:08', `Over billions of years, the solar wind may have built up huge deposits`],
    ['04:12', `Of Helium-3 on the moon.`],
    ['04:15', `Instead of making Helium-3, we can mine it.`],
    ['04:19', `If we could sift the lunar dust for helium,`],
    ['04:21', `We'd have enough fuel to power the entire world for thousands of years.`],
    ['04:25', `One more argument for establishing a moon base, if you weren't convinced already.`],
    ['04:30', `Ok, maybe you think building a mini sun`],
    ['04:33', `Still sound kind of dangerous`],
    ['04:37', `But they'd actually be much safer than most other types of powerplants`],
    ['04:42', `A fusion reactor is not like a nuclear plant,`],
    ['04:45', `Which can melt down catastrophically.`],
    ['04:47', `If the confinement failed, then the plasma would expand and cool,`],
    ['04:51', `And the reaction would stop.`],
    ['04:53', `Put simply, it's not a bomb.`],
    ['04:57', `The release of radioactive fuel, like Tritium,`],
    ['04:59', `Could pose a threat to the environment.`],
    ['05:02', `Tritium could bond with oxygen making radioactive water,`],
    ['05:05', `Which could be dangerous as it seeps into the environment.`],
    ['05:08', `Fortunately, there's no more than a few grams in use at a given time,`],
    ['05:13', `So a leak would be quickly diluted.`],
    ['05:16', `So we've just told you that theres nearly unlimited energy to be had`],
    ['05:19', `At no expense to the environment`],
    ['05:21', `In something as simple as water.`],
    ['05:23', `So, whats the catch?`],
    ['05:26', `Cost. We simply don't know if fusion power will ever be commercially viable.`],
    ['05:31', `Even if they work, they might be too expensive to ever build.`],
    ['05:35', `The main drawback, is that it's unproven technology`],
    ['05:38', `Its a 10 billion dollar gamble`],
    ['05:40', `And that money might be better spent on other clean energy`],
    ['05:43', `That's already proven itself.`],
    ['05:46', `Maybe we should cut out losses`],
    ['05:48', `Or maybe, when the payoff is unlimited clean energy for everyone,`],
    ['05:53', `It might be worth the risk.`],
    ['05:56', `Videos like this one take hundreds of hours to make`],
    ['05:59', `and are made possible by your contributions on patreon.com`],
    ['06:02', `If you want to learn more about global energy,`],
    ['06:04', `Here's a playlist about nuclear energy, fracking and solar power.`],
    ['06:07', `Let us know in the comments if there are other technologies you want us to explain.`]
