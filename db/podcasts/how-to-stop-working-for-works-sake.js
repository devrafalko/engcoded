    ['06:15', `the book and then helped me create this`],
    ['06:19', `topic for the podcast episode so that is`],
    ['06:23', `how its come to mind but this episode is`],
    ['06:26', `really heavily influenced by what I've`],
    ['06:28', `learned from Tim Ferriss about this and`],
    ['06:31', `I would say from what I've heard of him`],
    ['06:33', `and I've listened to a lot of his`],
    ['06:36', `podcast episodes on the Tim Ferriss show`],
    ['06:38', `that he typically also has`],

    ['07:00', `the reasons that we typically tend to`],
    ['07:04', `work for works sake and there are a lot`],

    ['07:07', `down one is because we don't know what`],
    ['07:10', `else to do with our time and for me that`],
    ['07:14', `has been one of the biggest this year I`],

    ['07:21', `have a day off`],
    ['07:22', `blogging slash my business every week in`],
    ['07:25', `that day being Sunday because I was`],

    ['07:31', `everything at any time of day and not`],
    ['07:34', `having any kind of constraint around it`],
    ['07:36', `meant that there was never a sense of`],

    ['07:41', `task to the next day and then push it to`],
    ['07:42', `the next day and that it meant when I`],
    ['07:45', `was working I wasn't well rested because`],
    ['07:48', `I'm constantly working in my business so`],
    ['07:53', `having that day off is something that I`],
    ['07:56', `implemented I'm pretty sure it was when`],
    ['07:59', `I read the 4-hour workweek I decided to`],
    ['08:02', `bring that back though I can't quite`],
    ['08:03', `remember the timing of it but that the`],
    ['08:07', `reason identified as well that I wasn't`],
    ['08:10', `giving myself that day off it was`],
    ['08:13', `because I literally didn't know what`],
    ['08:14', `else to do with my time`],
    ['08:17', `and I love my business I loved personal`],
    ['08:20', `development but I think it's so powerful`],

    ['08:27', `and to not just be working 24/7 just`],
    ['08:31', `because I love it doesn't mean that I`],

    ['08:57', `half of the year I forced myself to have`],
    ['09:00', `one day off every week which has been`],
    ['09:02', `incredible in terms of productivity`],
    ['09:04', `because I have to be much more mindful`],
    ['09:06', `with the time that I do have but if I`],
    ['09:09', `have not had any plans or have basically`],
