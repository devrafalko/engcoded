    ['09:15', `productive or now I can focus or I'm so`],
    ['09:18', `glad there aren't any distractions`],
    ['09:19', `whatever it is have a think about that`],
    ['09:21', `and if it's too much of a stretch you`],
    ['09:23', `might need to create a more neutral`],
    ['09:25', `story for yourself like there's a`],
    ['09:27', `possibility I could be just as`],

    ['35:41', `treat yourself with respect and often`],
    ['35:45', `the easiest way to figure out how that`],
    ['35:47', `would look is to think about how you`],
    ['35:48', `would treat someone else who you respect`],
    ['35:51', `and for me part of that includes getting`],
    ['35:55', `dressed I don't want much makeup but I`],

    ['36:26', `get to rest I just show up in a bit of a`],
    ['36:29', `different way and it's that active self`],
    ['36:33', `respect for me and my experience of it`],
    ['36:36', `so that could help make a difference as`],
    ['36:38', `well I also find making the bed really`],
