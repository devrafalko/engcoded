    paragraph(`Like it or not, you are going to die. Stoics therefore advise you, even though you may be young and in perfect health, to contemplate your death. Let us explore some of the forms this contemplation can take.`),
    paragraph(`In Chapter 6 we encountered the negative visualization technique. In a typical visualization exercise, you imagine—and even try to visualize—not having something that you in fact have, such as your lunch, your home, or your spouse. You don’t, as we have seen, dwell on the possibility of losing these things; you simply allow yourself to have a flickering thought about it. The whole process requires minimal mental effort and takes only a few seconds. Using this technique will temporarily curb your tendency to take the elements of your daily existence for granted and will thereby enhance your ability to take delight in the life you happen to be living.`),
    paragraph(`As a meditation on death, you could try to imagine what it would be like to lose not your job or your spouse but your very existence. This, however, is impossible to do: if you have ceased to exist, there is no one left to experience what it is like to be dead. You could alternatively imagine what the world would be like if you had never been born, but this would be mere speculation on your part, unless you had the assistance of someone like Clarence Odbody—the fictional angel, second class, from the 1946 movie It’s a Wonderful Life. Fortunately, there are variants of the negative visualization technique that can play an important role in your death meditations.`),
    paragraph(`One is what might be called last-time meditation, in which you acknowledge that because you are mortal, there will be a last time for everything you do. There will be a last time you flip a light switch, a last time you eat dinner, and a last time you say goodbye to your parents, spouse, children, and friends. You have already done some things for the last time: there is a very good chance, for example, that you will never again dial a rotary telephone, type on a typewriter, or take a math exam. There will be a last time you lay your head on a pillow, as well as a last time you take a breath.`),
    paragraph(`To last-time meditate, you periodically pause in your daily routine to reflect that no matter what you are doing, there is a chance that this is the last time you will ever do it. Indeed, there is an off chance that this book is the last one you will ever read, and even that this very sentence is the last you will read—although I sincerely hope you not only finish the remaining sentences of this book but go on to have a long and happy life thereafter. These last-time meditations may sound depressing, but they have the power to infuse everyday occurrences with meaning.`),
    paragraph(`Another variant of negative visualization involves what might be called prospective retrospection. To employ this technique, you periodically pause, as you are going about your daily routine, to reflect on the likelihood that at some point in the future, you will wish you could travel back in time to this very moment. You may be doing something mundane, like driving to the store to buy food to cook for dinner. Live long enough, though, and you might someday find yourself wishing that you could again perform this utterly prosaic task.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose you successfully avoid death for many decades, and as a result your children place you in a nursing home. Sitting there, with a television blaring in the far corner of the commons room, you might find yourself longing for the good old days when you still had a car to drive and were fit enough to cook yourself dinner. Those days will seem like a dream world. In doing prospective retrospection, you simply remind yourself that at the present moment, almost regardless of what you are doing, you are quite likely living in the dream world of your future self. Enjoy living that dream!`),
    paragraph(`Some people will interpret these mortality meditations as symptoms of an unhealthy obsession with death, but Stoics would argue just the opposite. In doing these meditations, you are not dwelling on death. They are momentary, impromptu exercises, and rather than being depressing, they can be curiously revitalizing.`),
    paragraph(`Many people are bored by or even loathe their daily routine. This is unfortunate, since a life filled with loathed days will end up being a loathed life. By engaging in negative visualization and its variants, you can increase the chance that, instead of simply enduring the moments of your life, you savor them to the greatest extent possible and thereby increase your chances of extracting every drop of delight that your life has to offer. You might find that instead of simply grinding through your allotted days, you embrace and even celebrate the life you find yourself living.`),
    paragraph(`Stoics would even go so far as to assert that you are lucky to be mortal. If you were immortal and knew it, you would be far more likely to take your days for granted. You squandered today? Not to worry, since the immortal you would always have a tomorrow. Acknowledge your mortality, though, and you will be acutely aware that every day you live represents a withdrawal from a life bank that has a finite number of days in it. In most circumstances, you don’t know what that number is. It might be as low as 1, meaning that this is your last day alive, but it might also be 25,500, meaning that you have seventy years more to live. Since you have a finite number of days left to you, they are precious, and it would be foolish to waste them.`),
    paragraph(`YOU LIKELY WENT THROUGH EARLY CHILDHOOD oblivious to your own mortality. Then, perhaps in response to the death of a pet, neighbor, or relative, you found out that things die. Sometime after that, it dawned on you that you would also die, but your understanding of your mortality might be described as nebulous and theoretical. Yes, you would die, but it would be sometime in the distant future, likely decades and decades away. This assumption made it possible for you to shove thoughts of death into the back of your mind, maybe even into one of the closets conveniently located there.`),
    paragraph(`Some people never move beyond this level of understanding their mortality. They go to bed young and healthy, the way they have thousands of times before, only to die in their sleep. Most people, though, will at some point in their life be forced to confront their mortality. On a visit to their doctor, for example, they might be informed that they have advanced pancreatic cancer and have only a year of life remaining. Or on the field of battle, they might know, without anyone saying a word, that they have been shot, are losing copious amounts of blood, and have only a few minutes more to live.`),
    paragraph(`When, as a child, you became aware that animals and people die, your parents probably gave you a sugarcoated explanation of death. They might have told you that in dying, your dog Rover didn’t cease to exist but went to heaven, where he was quite happy. They said the same of the relatives and neighbors who died. This raised the possibility that you might, when you ultimately joined them in heaven, be treated to the sight of your grandma holding Rover in her lap. Wouldn’t that be grand?`),
    paragraph(`Many people never really move on from this childhood conception of death, and it is easy to understand why. Believing in heaven not only takes the sting out of death but potentially makes death something to long for. In heaven, after all, you get to see all the people you loved who parted life ahead of you. You also get a do-over on life. And because heaven is eternal, you don’t have to go through that second chance at life fearing the death of your dog, your loved ones, and most significantly, yourself. What could be better?`),
    paragraph(`The prospect of life in heaven raises some important questions. There is scant evidence that we will have a continued existence after our earthly demise, but suppose that such an existence is possible. You might end up spending it not in heaven but in hell. Even if you are a devout Roman Catholic who has done everything that, according to your faith, is necessary to ascend to heaven—indeed, even if you are the pope himself—it might turn out that the earth’s 1.8 billion Muslims are right, so you have wasted your time. Conversely, if you are a devout Muslim who has done everything necessary to ascend to heaven—known by them as Jannah or Paradise—the earth’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics may turn out to be right, in which case, too bad for you.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose, for the sake of argument, that you do end up in heaven. As we have seen, it isn’t clear that you will live happily ever after there; indeed, retain your earthly tendency to take whatever you have for granted, and you might, before very long, start taking your heavenly existence for granted, and a short time after that, you might start complaining about life in heaven.`),
    paragraph(`Sometimes when I tell people this, they respond by saying they are going to turn over a new leaf when they die and will be very satisfied with their heavenly existence. My question for them: if they have it in their power to become capable of satisfaction, why not use that power while still on earth, thereby making their earthly existence more heavenly than would otherwise be the case?`),
    paragraph(`SUPPOSE YOU CAME TO POSSESS INFORMATION about when and how you will die. What would you do with it? A Stoic would have no trouble answering this question. Since his primary goal in life is to attain and then maintain tranquility, he would spend the time that remained experiencing as few negative emotions as he can, with as little anxiety, fear, anger, and regret as possible. He would do his best to embrace the sources of delight that his life still had to offer. In more general terms, he would regard his dying days as an opportunity to top a good life with a beautiful and fitting capstone.`),
    paragraph(`At the same time, a Stoic will realize that obstacles can arise that make it very difficult for him to have a good death. One such obstacle is extreme pain. A Stoic will be quite adept at preventing negative emotions and in dealing with them if prevention efforts fail. Pain, however, is a sensation, not an emotion, and if it is sufficiently intense, it can undermine his reasoning ability, thereby depriving him of the tools the Stoic gods have given him for dealing with life’s challenges. The onset of dementia late in life can likewise strip him of his reasoning ability, resulting in an unfortunate end to what was a very good life.`),
    paragraph(`The goal of remaining tranquil until we die seems eminently sensible, but how can we accomplish it? We can once again use the Stoic test strategy, only now the challenge we are dealing with will be the loss not of our cell phone, our job, or our freedom, but of our very life. We can think of it as our Stoic exit exam, the test that all the previous Stoic tests have been preparing us for. In Chapter 7 we saw how, through the clever use of framing, we can make everyday setbacks more tolerable. We can likewise employ framing to ease our passage from life.`),
    paragraph(`Like any Stoic test, our Stoic exit exam has two components. The first is to look for a workaround for the setback. If we have received a cancer diagnosis, we should probably get a second opinion and even look into experimental treatments. Likewise, if we have been wounded on the field of battle, we should try to slow the loss of blood in case help arrives. In doing these things, it is important that to the extent possible, we stay calm and focused.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose, however, that our search for a workaround is unsuccessful. Our death, we conclude, is both imminent and unavoidable. We must then turn our attention to a different undertaking: having the best death possible. This is when our Stoic training can come into play.`),
    paragraph(`Consider again the last-time meditation that I discussed earlier in this chapter. When we finally do become aware of the likely time and circumstances of our death, we might find ourselves doing it as part of our daily routine. We will be poignantly aware that the conversations we are having, the meals we are eating, and the kisses we are sharing could be our last. They will therefore have special meaning. Paradoxically, it is possible that in dying, we will be more alive than we have ever been. The prospect of death will, at last, make us fully aware of how beautiful, how wonderful our life is.`),
    paragraph(`In order to have our best chance at a good death, we must keep in mind the Stoic principle that we should not concern ourselves with things we cannot control. Doing so is a waste of time under any circumstances, but doing so in our dying days is a waste of the precious little time we have remaining: rather than fighting our imminent death, we need to embrace it. Many elderly people realize this instinctively and inform those around them that it is their time to go.`),
    paragraph(`Another central principle of Stoicism is that we should be socially useful: we should, that is, do what we can to help those around us have better lives. A Stoic will know that her dying presents a wonderful opportunity for her to encourage others to rethink their way of living. She can remind those around her that inasmuch as they have only one life to live, they are foolish to waste even a moment of it being miserable when they have it in their power to experience delight. And she can simultaneously demonstrate to them, during her last days of life, what it means to have a good death.`),
    paragraph(`LET US END THIS DISCUSSION of death by considering three cases. In 1996 the psychologist Amos Tversky learned that he was dying of metastatic melanoma. He carried on his normal routine, and most of those who encountered him were oblivious to his condition. He died not long afterward, at age fifty-nine. During a discussion of his impending death, he told a friend: “Life is a book. The fact that it was a short book doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good book. It was a very good book.”1`),
    paragraph(`Although Tversky died a natural death, he had obtained drugs that would allow him to end his life quickly and painlessly, if he chose to do so. The ancient Stoics would have understood this choice. They thought that under some circumstances, suicide wasn’t just morally acceptable; it was sensible. Seneca, for example, imagined God explaining his thinking to us: “I have made nothing easier than dying. I placed life on a downward slope: if it is prolonged, only observe and you will see how short, how easy is the path that leads to freedom.”2 Dying, then, is the easy part of your Stoic exit exam; the challenge is to retain your equanimity. I should add that as long as your continued existence can help others, Stoics would regard it as cowardly to commit suicide.`),
    paragraph(`Let me develop Tversky’s life-is-a-book metaphor a bit further. Living your life is like writing a novel that is a curious blend of fiction and nonfiction. Each day you must add another day’s events to the manuscript. You have considerable creative freedom with respect to the thoughts, utterances, and actions of the novel’s protagonist—yourself. He or she can do anything you are capable of doing. The other aspects of the novel must be utterly realistic, though. It must be set in the present-day actual world, and its characters must be existing people who respond to the protagonist’s actions exactly as they would in real life.`),
    paragraph(`Writing a novel that meets these specifications would be challenging enough, but it turns out that there is a complicating factor: your editor refuses to give you a deadline. She can download and publish your manuscript whenever she wants. Maybe she’ll do it tomorrow, or maybe she’ll wait several decades. The novel’s deadline, in other words, will resemble your life’s quite literal dead line.`),
    paragraph(`Your goal, under such circumstances, should be to make sure that no matter when your editor publishes your novel, it will stand as a complete work—or as complete as is humanly possible. Yes, some story elements will remain unresolved, but no important business will be left undone. In particular, those who helped you will have been thanked for their help, and the people you love will know of this love. There will be precious few things about the plot that you would want to change, if you had it in your power to do so. This is in part because of the choices you made but also, and more important, because you made it your business to embrace whatever life you found yourself living.`),
    paragraph(`BESIDES FRAMING OUR DEATH AS A TEST, we can frame it as an adventure—indeed, as the last and in many respects the greatest adventure of our life. If we do this, instead of approaching death with dread, we can approach it with anticipation. I know this sounds strange, but the ancient Stoic philosopher Julius Canus apparently succeeded in doing just that.`),
    paragraph(`During his reign, the Roman emperor Caligula condemned numerous people to death, often for frivolous reasons. Canus was among them. When the centurion came to lead him to his execution, he was playing a board game with another prisoner. He complained not about being taken away to die but about being prevented from finishing the game. He told the centurion not to believe his opponent if he subsequently claimed to have won the game, since Canus had been one piece ahead when his circumstances forced him to retire.3 This action likely involved a bit of posturing on his part, and yet even two millennia later, it is an impressive bit of philosophical theater.`),
    paragraph(`And how did Canus succeed in taking so much of the sting out of his impending death? By treating it as an adventure. Just before his execution, someone asked him for his thoughts. He replied that he was preparing to observe the moment of death: would his spirit be able to witness its departure from his body? Even though his death would be a fatal setback to his future, he found a way to extract value from it and thereby gave it a silver lining.`),
    paragraph(`The American poet Mary Oliver is winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. In her poem “When Death Comes,” she expresses an outlook on death that resembles that of Canus. She tells us that when death comes—like “an iceberg between the shoulder blades”—she doesn’t want to realize, now that it is too late to do anything about it, that she has simply been a visitor in this world. She doesn’t want to end up sighing, frightened, or arguing. She wants instead to enter that “cottage of darkness” full of curiosity, knowing that she spent her life play ing the role of “a bride married to amazement.” Whether Oliver realizes it or not, hers is a Stoic approach to living and dying.`),
    paragraph(`OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN STOICS, Seneca has played the biggest role in this book. He had many insights not only into setbacks but also into death, the final setback. Allow me, then, to end this chapter by describing his death.`),
    paragraph(`The Stoics, as we have seen, had a tendency to get into trouble with the powers that be: Paconius Agrippinus was banished, Canus was executed, and Musonius Rufus was exiled, not once but twice. Seneca also got into trouble: Emperor Claudius condemned him to death for (allegedly) committing adultery. The sentence was commuted to exile to the island of Corsica. When Seneca returned from exile, Nero was emperor, and Seneca became one of his principal advisers. Nero started behaving erratically, though, and subsequently condemned Seneca to death for (allegedly) conspiring against him.`),
    paragraph(`Seneca was given the choice of either killing himself or being killed by someone else. He chose the former option. Friends and family were allowed to be present during his final moments. When some of them wept, he responded by chastising them for abandoning their Stoicism, just when it would have been quite useful. He embraced his wife and cut the veins in his arms—but didn’t die. Because of old age and infirmity, he was a slow bleeder. He then cut the arteries in his legs, but he still didn’t die. He requested poison and drank it, but again, without the desired effect. Finally he was carried into a steam bath, where he parted from life. All this time, he remained true to his Stoic principles.`),
    paragraph(`If the Stoic gods were watching, they surely shed a tear on his behalf. They were themselves Stoics, after all, and as such they would have greatly appreciated the magnificence of Seneca’s exit from life.`)
