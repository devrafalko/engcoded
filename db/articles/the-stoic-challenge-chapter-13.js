  author: { name: 'William B. Irvine' },

    paragraph(`Most setbacks are easily avoided. Simply by checking your car’s fuel gauge, for example, you can avoid running out of gas on the freeway. Likewise, by checking the weather report before embarking on a walk, you can avoid getting caught in the rain without an umbrella. Another thing you can do to avoid setbacks is learn more about how the world works. Someone who has taken the time to learn how computers work, or how a particular application works, will likely experience far fewer setbacks than someone who hasn’t. When her computer “acts up,” she will know how to fix the problem.`),
    paragraph(`We have, however, another, rather less obvious way to decrease the number of setbacks we experience. For an event to count as a setback, it must not only come as a surprise to us but must, from our point of view, count as a change for the worse. Besides taking steps to avoid being surprised by undesirable events, Stoics recommend that we take steps to change what, for us, counts as an undesirable event. This suggestion sounds farfetched, I realize, so allow me to explain.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose a couple are driving to the airport on a hot summer day. Halfway there, the car’s air conditioner stops working, and the temperature inside the car soars. For the husband, the heat is no big deal: because he is a geologist, he is accustomed to being out in the sun. His wife, though, is a computer programmer who spends her days in a climate-controlled office. She breaks into a sweat and before long starts complaining. For her, the air conditioner malfunction is a significant and unforeseen change for the worse, so for her, it counts as a setback.`),
    paragraph(`Fast-forward, and suppose the couple have taken their seats in a plane. The wife is now considerably more comfortable than she was in the car. The cabin of the airplane is, after all, a climate-controlled environment. Meanwhile her husband has broken into a cold sweat, because he has an intense fear of flying. Whereas the discomfort his wife experienced in the car was physical, his is emotional, but it is nevertheless very real and is in many respects worse than hers. As the plane rolls out onto the runway, his wife holds his hand and says reassuring things, with little effect. He expresses his anger about having to take such a trip and swears that he will never, ever fly again.`),
    paragraph(`This tale illustrates something we all know: different people have different comfort zones. Some have very broad zones and can therefore feel comfortable in a wide range of circumstances: we might even be surprised to hear them express discomfort. Other people are uncomfortable unless everything is just so.`),
    paragraph(`For whatever reason, these hard-to-please individuals often feel a need to tell others about their discomfort. They want the rest of us to be aware of it and ideally to do something about it. Suppose that in an attempt to please them, we turn on the air conditioning in the room that they say is too hot. They might now complain that the air conditioner is too noisy. Their lives must be difficult—as are the lives of those who have to deal with them on a daily basis.`),
    paragraph(`WHY DO WE HAVE the comfort zones we do? And why do different people have different-sized zones? You might think it is a consequence of our genetic makeup, and to some extent it is. To a much greater extent, though, our life experience determines the size and shape of our comfort zone. In particular, if we make a point of exposing ourselves to things that make us either physically or emotionally uncomfortable, we can train ourselves to be comfortable with them and thereby expand our comfort zone.`),
    paragraph(`The ancient Stoics realized this and made comfort zone expansion—let us refer to it as toughness training—part of their Stoic practice.1 They made a point of periodically going out of their way to do things that made them uncomfortable. This may sound masochistic, but the Stoics knew that exposure to discomfort, if done in a systematic fashion, would have the effect of reducing the total amount of discomfort they experienced in daily living. It was therefore a good investment of their time and energy.`),
    paragraph(`Before I go any further, let me clarify the difference between toughness training and Stoic adventures (see Chapter 11). We undertake Stoic adventures, such as trying to climb a mountain, so we can experience setbacks—so we can, in other words, be surprised by unpleasant events. The Stoics knew that by doing this, we would sharpen our setback-response reflexes. Then, when we experienced a setback in daily living, we would, instead of getting frustrated or angry, simply label it a Stoic test and calmly set about trying to find the optimal workaround for it. By undertaking Stoic adventures, then, we are studying for the Stoic tests that life is likely to administer.`),
    paragraph(`When we engage in toughness training, by contrast, we aren’t hoping for our circumstances to take an unexpected turn for the worse. To the contrary, we are going out of our way to make them take a turn for the worse, so we can expand our comfort zone. In toughness training, in its purest form, there is zero element of surprise.`),
    paragraph(`That said, it is possible to combine toughness training with Stoic adventures. Suppose you contemplate climbing a 4,000-meter mountain as an adventure, in the expectation that the climb will present you with setbacks to deal with. Suppose, too, that you know from past experience that you are affected by altitude sickness when you climb mountains this high. For you, the adventure of climbing the mountain will therefore also count as toughness training. The ancient Stoics were fine with this two-for-the-price-of-one phenomenon; indeed, they might have quipped that the fact that we can study for Stoic tests while doing toughness training is proof that the Stoic gods love us and want us to thrive.`),
    paragraph(`I should also clarify the difference between toughness training and the practice of negative visualization (see Chapter 6). Negative visualization involves thinking about how things could be worse; toughness training involves causing things to be worse. In negative visualization, we might imagine that we have nothing to eat for lunch. What would that feel like? we will wonder. If we voluntarily skip lunch as part of our toughness training, we won’t simply wonder what it feels like to have nothing to eat; we will find out, and we will also find out that missing a meal is an utterly survivable event, which in turn will increase our self-confidence.`),
    paragraph(`YOUR COMFORT ZONE HAS TWO DIMENSIONS, one physical and the other emotional, and your goal in toughness training should be to expand both of them.`),
    paragraph(`To become emotionally tougher, you need to tackle your fears—you need, in other words, to deal with what we might think of as your scared self. (For the record, your scared self lives in your subconscious mind, next door to your lazy self.) You can do this by going out of your way to expose yourself, in measured doses, to the things you fear.2 If, for example, you have a fear of public speaking, part of your toughness training can be to seek out opportunities to appear before small and friendly audiences. When you feel comfortable doing this, you can move on to larger audiences. As a result of this desensitization process, you might someday, much to your amazement, find yourself standing fearlessly before an audience of hundreds of people.`),
    paragraph(`For evidence that this remedy for emotional discomfort is effective, consider the things you can do without a second thought. At a swimming pool, you might fearlessly dive from the diving board, but think back on all the fears you had to overcome in order to feel comfortable doing this. You first had to get accustomed to being in the shallow end of the pool without holding your parent’s hand. After that, you had to get accustomed to swimming in the deep end by yourself; then to jumping into the swimming pool from the deck; then to diving in headfirst from the deck; then to jumping in from the diving board; and finally to diving in from the diving board. At each of these steps, you would have experienced fear, and at each step, the fear would have dissipated after a few repetitions.`),
    paragraph(`Do you remember, the first time you drove a car, how scary it was? And do you remember the first time you parallel-parked a car? And now you do these things without a second thought. You may even do them while simultaneously checking your e-mail on your cell phone—which behavior, I should add, is not advisable.`),
    paragraph(`They say familiarity breeds contempt. This may or may not be true, but it is clear that familiarity breeds comfort: do something scary often enough, and it not only ceases to be scary, it becomes automatic. Some readers may not be able to relate to the above examples, for the simple reason that their fears prevented them from learning how to drive or swim. For these readers, yet another Stoic challenge is in order: start your toughness training by dealing with these fears. In other words, toughen yourself up by taking driving or swimming lessons.`),
    paragraph(`YOUR TOUGHNESS TRAINING, besides being concerned with things that make you emotionally uncomfortable, will be concerned with physical discomfort. In the summer, your training might require spending time outside in the heat even though you could instead spend it in an air-conditioned room. In winter, it might mean not just spending your time out in the cold but underdressing for that weather. As part of my own toughness training, for example, I make a point of allowing myself to be a bit chilly in October: I go out in shirtsleeves, while those around me are wearing sweaters. I have found that by doing this, I will be comfortably warm when January rolls around, even though I am wearing just a sweater while those around me are bundled up in multiple layers of clothing—but still seem cold.`),
    paragraph(`Your toughness training can extend to your diet. You can try skipping between-meal snacks and cutting down portion sizes at meals. Yes, you will feel hungry, but this will give you an opportunity to explore hunger, maybe for the first time in your life.3 As a result of this exploration, you will likely make some interesting discoveries. One is that your body will get used to the new eating regimen, so that even though you eat less food, you experience less hunger than you did before. It might then dawn on you that what you previously thought of as hunger wasn’t biological hunger at all; it was instead a psychological mélange of boredom and discontent.`),
    paragraph(`The dietary component of your toughness training might have a silver lining, in the form of weight loss. You might also discover that your meals are more deeply satisfying than they were before.`),
    paragraph(`Your toughness training should have an exercise component. Its form will obviously depend on how fit you currently are, as well as on your age and health. For some people, it might involve walking around the block; for others, it might involve running for miles. When you begin your program, you will likely find that it causes you a degree of physical discomfort, not only while you are exercising but after your workout has ended. You might feel tired for the rest of the day, and the next day you might be sore.`),
    paragraph(`It might, at this point, seem that your toughness training, rather than making you more comfortable, is having just the opposite effect. You need to keep in mind, though, that the goal of toughness training is not to let you live in uninterrupted comfort. It is to expand your comfort zone so you remain comfortable in a wider range of circumstances. This expansion has a price tag, in terms of discomfort, but on the whole, the comfort you gain will outweigh this cost.`),
    paragraph(`In particular, if you stick with your exercise program, you will discover not only that your exercise-induced soreness goes away, but that you are, on the whole, more comfortable than you used to be. Before you began your program, you might have gotten winded taking walks or climbing stairs; now you feel a spring in your step as you move around. You will also find it emotionally reassuring to know that because of your training, your body is better suited to deal with any physically challenging circumstances that you might encounter.`),
    paragraph(`AS YOU TOUGHEN UP, you can intensify your training—assuming, of course, that there are no health risks in doing so. If you walk to get exercise, for example, you can include segments of fast walking or even running in your workouts. If you are running, you can increase the distance, or experiment with doing sprints. Likewise, you can intensify the dietary component of your toughness training by experimenting with fasting. At first you can try skipping single meals, then move on to going an entire day without food. As a result of this training, you will become confident of your ability to deal with emergency situations. In particular, if unforeseen circumstances force you to miss a meal, you will be fine, inasmuch as you will simply be doing involuntarily something you have done voluntarily on many occasions.`),
    paragraph(`Your advanced toughness training can extend to your lifestyle. You can dramatically simplify your way of living for a time. Seneca, one of the richest men in Rome, would periodically “practice poverty.” He advised the rest of us to follow his example by setting aside “a number of days during which you will be content with the plainest of food, and very little of it, and with rough, coarse clothing, and will ask yourself, ‘Is this what one used to dread?’ ”4`),
    paragraph(`Whereas Seneca advocated that we set aside periods to live as if we were poor, Musonius Rufus, the Stoic philosopher who handled so well his banishment to Gyaros (see Chapter 4), thought we should always live simply. At mealtimes, he said, we should learn to be satisfied with sensible amounts of simple foods. Our clothing should also be simple, and when we choose our dwelling place, we need to keep in mind that its primary purpose is to shelter us from the weather, as well as to keep out excessive heat and cold—needs that can be met, he adds, by living in a small cave.5`),
    paragraph(`Regardless of whether you practice poverty or choose merely to live simply, you should make a point of looking for the sources of delight that remain available to you. If the day is clear, be sure to notice the sky: it didn’t have to be blue, but it is, and isn’t that wonderful? And if you are indoors, be sure to appreciate the smiles on the faces of the people you encounter. Those smiles are a wonderful gift that is all too easy to take for granted.`),
    paragraph(`As you collect sources of delight, you might experience what I call meta-delight—you might, that is, take delight in your ability to take delight in such things. Seneca was aware of this phenomenon: “Barley porridge, or a crust of barley bread, and water do not make a very cheerful diet, but nothing gives one keener pleasure than the ability to derive pleasure even from that.”6`),
    paragraph(`BEFORE ENDING THIS DISCUSSION of toughness training, some additional clarification is in order. The training exercises I have described may sound like acts of self-denial performed by adher ents of exotic religions, but there is an important difference. In most cases, religious ascetics deny themselves pleasures and subject themselves to various discomforts so they can experience a better afterlife. God, they think, will be impressed by their seriousness and consequently will reward them with a heavenly eternity. By contrast, Stoics engage in toughness training so they can have a better life.`),
    paragraph(`The ancient Stoics obviously weren’t hedonists. Their goal was not to maximize the amount of pleasure they experienced; it was to attain and maintain tranquility. But suppose you told a Stoic that after considering your philosophical options, you decided not to join him but instead to become a full-out hedonist: you were going to live for pleasure.`),
    paragraph(`Even then, the Stoics would advise you to engage in toughness training. This is because, as strange as it may seem, experiencing too much comfort will reduce your capacity for experiencing pleasure. As Seneca put it, “When mind and body have been corrupted by pleasure, nothing seems bearable—not because the things which you suffer are hard, but because you are soft.”7 Toughness training will also intensify whatever pleasures you do experience. If you spend the morning out in the cold as part of your training, the warmth you experience when you come in will be delicious. Eat ice cream every day, and if it is good ice cream, it will be satisfying; eat ice cream only a few times a year, though, and it will be so incredibly delicious that you might find yourself pitying those who, if only they were less hedonistic, could experience this level of pleasure.`)
