    paragraph(`As we have seen, our interpretation of an event is like the frame of a painting. Put a Rembrandt in one sort of frame, and it will look hideous; switch it to another, and it will look sublime. The same is true of the setbacks we experience. Put a setback in one psychological frame, and we will find it upsetting; put it in another, and we may discover, much to our amazement, that we enjoy dealing with that setback.`),
    paragraph(`As we have also seen, when you encounter a setback, your subconscious mind goes into action. It tries to make sense of what is going on by providing a frame for the setback. But even though it has lots of frames to choose from, it tends to favor the blame frame: it assumes that you have been wronged, that some person or group of people has it in for you. This likely triggers anger in you, which in turn makes it harder for you to deal with the setback.`),
    paragraph(`Stoics recommend that when we experience a setback, we make a point of consciously framing it as a kind of test. Allow ourselves to get frustrated, and we get a low grade; allow ourselves to become angry or despondent—or even worse, regard ourselves as victims—and we fail. Ideally, the setback won’t give rise to negative emotions within us, not because we are successfully concealing our distress but because we have no distress to conceal.`),
    paragraph(`LET US EXPLORE THE STOIC TEST STRATEGY in greater detail. The idea that we treat a setback as a test gives rise to an obvious question: who or what is administering the test? Seneca suggested that “God” is behind it. Before unpacking this suggestion, though, I should explain that the Roman concept of God was rather different from that of modern Christians. For one thing, the Romans didn’t have one God; they had several, and their head god, Jupiter, was very much unlike the God of Christianity. Case in point: Jupiter, a married god at the time, assumed the form of a bull so he could seduce—or was it rape?—the goddess Europa, something that the God of Christianity would never dream of doing.`),
    paragraph(`According to Seneca, God (think Jupiter) sets us back not to punish us but to give us an opportunity to do something courageous and thereby increase our chances of attaining “the highest possible excellence.” God, Seneca explains,`),
    paragraph(`hardens, reviews, and disciplines those who have won his approval and love; but those whom he seems to favor, whom he seems to spare, he is keeping soft against the misfortunes that are to come. You are wrong if you think anyone has been exempted from ill; the man who has known happiness for many a year will receive his share some day; whoever seems to have been set free from this has only been granted a delay.1`),
    paragraph(`We should therefore be flattered if we encounter setbacks. Paradoxically, it is evidence that we have caught the attention of God—indeed, that he regards us as a candidate for achieving human excellence. God, says Seneca, knows that “a man needs to be put to the test if he is to gain self-knowledge” and that “only by trying does he learn what his capacities are.”2`),
    paragraph(`Seneca provides several analogies3 to help us appreciate God’s motives in setting us back. God, he says, resembles a Roman head of household who “does not pamper a good man like a favorite slave; he puts him to the test, hardens him, and makes him ready for his service.” Seneca’s God resembles a strict father who “orders his children to be roused early to pursue their studies, not allowing them to be idle even on a holiday, and wrings from them sweat and sometimes tears.” This fatherly God wants his children to “know the pain of toil, of suffering, of loss, so that they may acquire true strength.” He resembles an army general who sends a soldier to carry out a dangerous mission. That soldier won’t, if he is brave, think that the general has done him a bad turn. He will instead conclude that the general thinks him brave and daring enough to accomplish the mission. It is, if anything, a sign of favor. God also resembles a teacher who requires “greater effort from the ones who inspire the surer hope.”`),
    paragraph(`Epictetus agrees with Seneca regarding God’s goals. At one point in his Discourses, he imagines a conversation in which God explains why humans experience setbacks:`),
    paragraph(`If it had been possible, Epictetus, I [God] would have ensured that your poor body and petty possessions were free and immune from hindrance. But as things are, you mustn’t forget that this body isn’t truly your own, but is nothing more than cleverly moulded clay. But since I couldn’t give you that, I’ve given you a certain portion of myself, this faculty of motivation to act and not to act, of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the power to make proper use of impressions; if you pay good heed to this, and entrust all that you have to its keeping, you’ll never be hindered, never obstructed, and you’ll never groan, never find fault, and never flatter anyone at all.`),
    paragraph(`We humans, in other words, are hybrid creatures, part god and part animal. Our conscious mind, with its reasoning ability, is our godly component; our subconscious mind and emotions together form our animal component. Epictetus tells us that “it is difficulties that reveal what men amount to; and so, whenever you’re struck by a difficulty, remember that God, like a trainer in the gymnasium, has matched you against a tough young opponent.” And why would God do such a thing? “So that you may become an Olympic victor; and that is something that can’t be achieved without sweat.” 5`),
    paragraph(`Seneca, by the way, also makes reference to athletes in explaining the rationale for Stoic tests: “We see wrestlers . . . matching themselves with only the strongest opponents, and requiring those who prepare them for a bout to use all their strength against them; they expose themselves to blows and hurt, and if they do not find one man to match them, they take on several at a time.”6 They know that “excellence withers without an adversary.”7`),
    paragraph(`AT THIS POINT, you might be getting nervous: you don’t believe in the existence of Jupiter, so how can you use the Stoic test frame? If you believe in the existence of the God of Christianity, you have an easy solution: you can assume that he is testing you to make you stronger, to develop your character, and to make you more appreciative of the life you are living. These are things we would expect a loving father to do, and the God of Christianity, we are told, is the ultimate loving father. Something similar can be done if you are a Muslim who believes in the existence of Allah.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose, however, that like me, you don’t believe in the existence of Jupiter, the God of Christianity, or Allah. You can still employ the Stoic test strategy by believing your test givers to be imaginary Stoic gods. Although you know full well they don’t exist, they can still play a significant psychological role in your life. By invoking these beings, you are playing the frame game described in Chapter 7: you are framing the setbacks you experience in a manner that will profoundly alter your emotional response to them. For most people, setbacks are merely unfortunate events; with the judicious use of framing, you can turn the setbacks you experience into vehicles for self-transformation.`),
    paragraph(`For me, the Stoic gods are a convenient fiction. If you are a parent, you have likely had experience with such fictions. When your children were young and Christmas was coming, you might have invoked Santa Claus to get them to behave: “If you’re mean to the cat, Santa isn’t going to bring you very many presents.” It is a stimulus to which children respond. By employing the Stoic test strategy, your conscious mind can likewise shape the behavior of your credulous and rather childlike subconscious mind. It sounds strange, I know, but it works.`),
    paragraph(`Those who feel uncomfortable thinking in terms of even imaginary gods can take themselves to be tested by, say, an imaginary father, general, teacher, or coach. Indeed, on occasion, I take myself to be tested not by Stoic gods but by the ghost of Seneca. And in a deeper sense, the ghost of Seneca does exist. Because I have read his works, Seneca haunts my intellect, occasionally offering me a compliment but much more often raising his ghostly eyebrows at me in a look of dismay. Regardless of the imaginary tester we choose, the key thing is that we assume that we are being tested for our own good.`),
    paragraph(`As a result of my encounters with the (imaginary) Stoic gods, I have gained insight into their nature. They are, to begin with, quite powerful. They can cause me to cut myself while shaving and to trip on a root while walking through the woods. When I am at the airport, they can delay or even cancel the flight I am scheduled to take. Indeed, a disproportionate number of the setbacks I experience take place at airports, which has led me to wonder whether this is where the Stoic gods reside.`),
    paragraph(`The Stoic gods can also cause traffic jams and give people the flu. They have it in their power to bring on inconvenient thunderstorms and devastating earthquakes. They are also remarkably tech savvy. Recently, I was looking for airplane tickets online and came across the ideal tickets at a bargain price. In the minute or two that it took me to enter my information to procure them, the Stoic gods fiddled with the Internet in such a manner that the price rose by $100 per ticket. Perhaps someday, just to keep me off balance, they could surprise me with a similarly sized price drop?`),
    paragraph(`The Stoic gods, I have found, possess a mischievous sense of humor. Instead of causing my cell phone to stop working, as they could easily do, they might cause me to accidentally drop it into a glass of lemonade, producing the same result. Such things do happen.`),
    paragraph(`On occasion, instead of causing me to experience a setback, the Stoic gods are content to send me a reminder of the setbacks they can cause. Recently, for example, I was driving to a friend’s home. I had been there only a few times before, so I asked my cell phone for directions. It quickly provided them, along with a prediction that the trip would take one hour and four minutes. I knew this couldn’t be right, since my friend’s house is only a few miles away, so I examined the screen more closely. It turned out that my cell phone, instead of giving me driving directions, had given me walking directions—additional evidence of the technological savvy of the Stoic gods.`),
    paragraph(`Isn’t it wonderful, I thought, that I can get where I’m going in the comfort of my car rather than having to walk for more than an hour through a cold winter night? I thanked the Stoic gods for this possible-setback reminder and drove off into the night. And as I drove, I reflected on how remarkable it is that I possess a handheld device that, in response to a verbal request, is capable of giving me audible directions for how to get practically anywhere I want to go, either on foot or by car.`),
    paragraph(`THE GODS WHO ADMINISTER STOIC TESTS do not grade them. You must therefore grade them yourself, and in coming up with a grade, you should take two things into account. The first is how you conducted your search for a workaround for the setback. Before committing to a course of action, did you consider your options? In doing so, did you engage in lateral thinking—did you think “outside the box”? And was the workaround that you finally chose optimal?`),
    paragraph(`An optimal workaround, by the way, won’t necessarily be a pleasant workaround. To be optimal, it need only be less unpleasant than the other possible workarounds. Along these lines, getting a foot amputated won’t be pleasant, but if the foot is severely gangrenous, amputation will be preferable to the next-best option—death.`),
    paragraph(`The second but more significant factor in grading your performance will be your emotional response to the setback. If you remain calm and collected, you will be worthy of, say, a B. If your goal is to get an A or even an A+ on the exam, though, you will have to do more than remain calm; you will have to welcome the setback and even perk up a bit on its appearance. In this respect, you need to resemble a fireman who, after years of training, is finally called on to put out a fire. At last, a chance to show his stuff!`),
    paragraph(`Notice that the two components of a Stoic test can receive different grades. You can hit on the optimal workaround to a setback but get quite upset over being set back, in which case your workaround grade will be high but your more important emotional-response grade will be low. Or you can stay calm while coming up with a less-than-optimal workaround, in which case your workaround grade will be low but your emotional-response grade will be high. It will often be the case, though, that the lower your emotional-response grade is, the lower your workaround grade will be: it is, after all, hard to think clearly and find the optimal workaround if you are angry, grieving, or despondent.`),
    paragraph(`Before turning the page, take a few minutes to consider the setbacks you have recently experienced—or, if you have started keeping the journal described in Chapter 1, take a look at the setbacks you’ve recorded there. How would you grade your responses to them? Are you satisfied with this grade? And if not, what can you do to improve your grade on future setbacks?`)
