    paragraph(`Different people respond to setbacks in different ways. Some people are quite sensitive to them: even a minor setback will have a significant impact on their emotional state, and after experiencing it, they won’t bounce back quickly. They might feel incapable of finding a workaround for the setback, or they might play the role of victim and complain to anyone who will listen how unfair it is that they were set back in this manner. They might go on to argue that because of their victimization, they shouldn’t have to come up with a workaround; someone else should have to do it for them.`),
    paragraph(`Most of us, though, are tougher than this. We respond to the setbacks we experience not by feeling helpless and defeated but by feeling frustrated. In many cases, this response is involuntary: we no more choose to get frustrated in the face of a setback than a hay fever sufferer chooses to sneeze when pollen is in the air. It’s just what we do.`),
    paragraph(`There is, however, an important difference between sneezing and getting frustrated. Sneezing removes whatever is irritating our sinuses and thereby makes us feel better. Getting frustrated, on the other hand, often begets anger. This is unfortunate, since anger is incompatible with happiness; indeed, anger can be thought of as anti-joy. Consequently, getting frustrated in response to a setback only makes things worse.`),
    paragraph(`Unfortunately, any anger we experience is likely to be contagious. This is because we often direct our setback-triggered anger at someone, and when we express our anger to that person, he or she could very well respond by returning it. In other cases, we share our anger not with the person who made us angry but with an innocent bystander. We do this in part because we seek to validate our anger: we want this person to assure us that we have every reason to be angry. Better still, we want this person to commiserate with us. The word commiserate comes from the Latin commiseratus, which in turn derives from com, meaning “with,” and miser, meaning “wretched.” We want them, in other words, to get angry as well, so they can share our wretchedness. Of course, if it was foolish for one person to get angry about something, it is twice as foolish for two people to do so, especially if the second person isn’t directly affected by whatever it was that made the first person angry.`),
    paragraph(`Along these lines, suppose that after I experience a setback, a friend tells me that she feels bad about it. Maybe she doesn’t literally feel bad—all she’s trying to say is that she wishes I hadn’t been set back. This behavior would be perfectly understandable. Suppose, however, that she literally does feel bad; suppose, in particular, that she is angry or sad about my having been set back. This is the last thing a Stoic like myself would want. I might ask a friend for advice on finding a workaround for a setback, but I would never ask—or expect—a friend to be angry or sad about my being set back. This sort of commiseration turns a setback for one person into a setback for two, without helping the first person overcome the setback. In other words, it only makes matters worse.`),
    paragraph(`WHEN WE BECOME ANGRY, we have two options: we can either express our anger or suppress it. If suppressed, our anger might take root in us and enter a kind of dormant state, only to spring back to life at an inopportune moment: a year after experiencing a setback that angered us, our anger might flare into our consciousness again. Furthermore, these anger flashbacks can continue for decades. As people age, they forget a lot, but they cling to old wrongs that were done them. A ninety-year-old woman, who doesn’t know what day of the week or even what year it is, might nevertheless be able to recount, in a fair amount of detail and with renewed ire, an incident that upset her half a century before.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose that instead of suppressing our anger, we express it. Do so in a manner that breaks the law, and we might end up in prison. And while expressing anger in a socially acceptable manner may or may not hurt the person at whom we are angry, it is certain to have a negative impact on ourselves.`),
    paragraph(`There are angry people who, when you try to calm them down, respond by saying that they have every right to be angry. If you point out that their anger is making them miserable, they might respond by saying, with some indignation, that they have every right to be miserable. If you then question the value of such a right, they might back off a bit and say that what they mean is that it is perfectly understandable that they would be miserable, given what they have been through. Yes, it is understandable, but it is nevertheless unfortunate. And wouldn’t it be tragic if they went through life needlessly miserable as the result of routinely experiencing anger that they could have avoided?`),
    paragraph(`The Stoic philosopher Seneca understood how much harm we do by allowing ourselves to get angry. In his essay “On Anger,” he asserts, “No plague has cost the human race more.”1 Because of anger, people insult and sue each other, they divorce each other, and they hit and even kill each other. Because of anger, the nations those people live in go to war, and as a result, millions might die at the hands of people they have never even met. Cities might be reduced to rubble, and civilizations might fall.`),
    paragraph(`SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO when we feel that someone has wronged us? Our first objective, says Seneca, should be to avoid getting angry. That way we will have no anger to deal with and therefore no anger either to express or to suppress. Lots of people will immediately dismiss this advice. We don’t have it in our power not to get angry, they will explain; it’s just what people do.`),
    paragraph(`I would argue to the contrary. Although I would not describe myself as an angry person, I am certainly capable of anger, but the role it plays in my life has changed as a result of studying Stoic philosophy.`),
    paragraph(`My epiphany regarding anger came at a doctor’s office. It is my custom to bring along reading material to medical appointments, since doctors are so often late. On this day I had brought—what else?—Seneca’s essay on anger. The doctor ended up being an hour late, and during that hour, I made an interesting discovery: although I knew full well that I had every right to be angry at her for making me wait, I just couldn’t bring myself to do so. Seneca had me convinced that it would be a foolish thing to do—that by getting angry, I would only be hurting myself. This incident demonstrated the possibility of thinking my way out of becoming angry, something I had previously thought was impossible.`),
    paragraph(`As a result of this epiphany, I started paying attention to the role anger played in my life. In traffic jams, I watched myself yell at the drivers of other cars. They couldn’t hear me, though, and even if they could, they were as stuck as I was and therefore could do little other than what they were doing. So why yell? Wasn’t it because yelling made me feel better? It might indeed have done so, but only for a moment. Then my anger would rise again. I would have been far better off, I told myself, not to have gotten angry in the first place; then I wouldn’t have felt a need to do something to make myself feel better—temporarily.`),
    paragraph(`As I continued my investigation of anger, I gathered additional evidence of the harm I did myself by getting angry. I found myself, for example, yelling at the politicians I saw on television. Wasn’t this foolish behavior, inasmuch as they couldn’t hear me? I also watched as anger I had experienced in the past rekindled within me. I would be just about to fall asleep when some wrong done to me months before would drift into my mind. I would then toss and turn for a few hours and wake up crabby the next day.`),
    paragraph(`As a result of this investigation, I found myself getting angry about my tendency to get angry about foolish things. It was time, I decided, to deal with my anger issues. In particular, if I could learn how not to get angry about the setbacks I experienced in everyday life, there wouldn’t be much anger left to deal with.`),
    paragraph(`At this point, I could have done the obvious thing and started seeing an anger management therapist. Because of my exposure to the Stoics, though, I knew another option was available to me: I could take a closer look at Stoic advice on anger management and experiment with it. What I have found is that this advice has not lost its effectiveness in the two millennia since it was first promulgated. That is why I am sharing it with readers.`),
