    paragraph(`We might pity those who are broken or incapacitated by life’s setbacks. Theirs cannot be a happy existence. We might also sympathize with those who respond to setbacks with frustration and anger. It is such a common response that we might have concluded that it is, for us humans, the default response. Look around us, though, and we can find individuals who quickly bounce back from a setback—or better still, who don’t need to bounce, since they don’t get upset to begin with. Such individuals come off looking strong and even heroic.`),
    paragraph(`The astronaut Neil Armstrong was one of them. He had been chosen to pilot the lunar excursion module on the Apollo 8 moon mission. This was the vehicle that would land on the moon’s surface while the command module remained in orbit. To perfect his landing technique, Armstrong practiced by flying a lunar lander trainer here on Earth. This ungainly vehicle consisted of a central rocket to provide lift, surrounded by side-pointing thrusters to provide stability. Flying it was likened to trying to balance a dinner plate on the end of a broom handle.`),
    paragraph(`Armstrong had flown the vehicle successfully many times, but on May 6, 1968, a thruster stuck, meaning that he lost control. The craft started tilting erratically, and finally, when it was just about to turn upside down, Armstrong ejected. Two seconds later the vehicle crashed and was instantly engulfed in a fireball. Other than biting his tongue at the end of his parachute-assisted landing, Armstrong walked away unscathed.1`),
    paragraph(`A few hours after the crash, another astronaut, Alan Bean, encountered Armstrong, still in his flight suit and doing paperwork. He exchanged pleasantries with Armstrong and went on his way. Only then did someone tell him what had happened. In a state of disbelief, Bean went back to Armstrong’s office to ask whether he had indeed crashed the lander. “Yeah,” Armstrong responded. “I did.” Pressed for details, Armstrong explained that “I lost control and had to bail out of the darn thing.” And that was all he had to say.`),
    paragraph(`Bean subsequently commented that if another astronaut had survived a crash landing, he would have made a big deal of it. He wouldn’t have complained, but if he survived, he would have boasted of his piloting skills:`),
    paragraph(`I don’t think it was that Neil was so extraordinarily cooler than the other guys. But offhand, I can’t think of another person, let alone another astronaut, who would have just gone back to his office after ejecting a fraction of a second before getting killed. He never got up at an all-pilots meeting and told us anything about it. That was an incident that colored my opinion about Neil ever since. He was so different than other people.2`),
    paragraph(`It turns out that Armstrong, although unusual, is by no means unique. Look around, and we can find other examples of people who have demonstrated the ability to rise, quietly and bravely, to the challenges presented by significant setbacks.`),
    paragraph(`EARLY ON THE MORNING of October 31, 2003, thirteen-year-old Bethany Hamilton went surfing off the coast of Kauai, one of the Hawaiian Islands. She was accompanied by her best friend, Alana Blanchard, along with Alana’s father and brother.3 The water was calm, so they relaxed on their boards, hoping the surf would build. Hamilton’s right hand was holding the tip of her board, while her left arm dangled in the cool water. Then without warning, there was a flash of gray. Before she could comprehend what was happening, a shark bit off her left arm, just below the shoulder. In an instant, the water turned bright red. Strangely, because the injury was so severe, Hamilton experienced little pain. She did her best to stay calm and started paddling toward shore with her remaining arm.`),
    paragraph(`With the help of her fellow surfers, she made it to the shore and was rushed to the hospital. By the time they got there, she had lost an estimated 60 percent of her blood and was very close to dead. Through a remarkable coincidence, her father was already at the hospital. He had been scheduled to have knee surgery that morning and was on the operating table when a nurse came in and said he would have to leave in order to make room for an incoming shark attack victim, a thirteen-year-old girl. He knew the local surfing community well enough to guess that the girl was either his daughter Bethany or her friend Alana. A few minutes later he was informed that it was indeed his daughter.`),
    paragraph(`Hamilton had started surfing as a child, and by age seven, she could catch and ride waves without assistance from her parents. Not long thereafter, she won the first surfing competition she entered. By the time she was thirteen, she not only had won dozens of trophies but also had a sponsor. Her goal, before the attack, had been to become a pro surfer.`),
    paragraph(`As Hamilton lay in the hospital recovering, she considered her options. She concluded that her surfing days were over: how can you surf with only one arm? Perhaps she would become a surf photographer, or maybe she would switch to soccer, a sport in which arms play a minor role. Shortly thereafter, though, she decided it was too early to give up on surfing. Her doctor was encouraging. He explained that although the list of things she would have to do differently was very long, the list of things she couldn’t do was short. He gave her permission to give surfing another try, as long as she waited until her stitches were out.`),
    paragraph(`During her recovery, Hamilton became aware of all the obstacles she would have to surmount in order to get her life back on track. How, she wondered, do you button a shirt or tie your shoes with only one hand? And how do you peel an orange? With a bit of research and experimentation, she was able to find workarounds. She stocked her wardrobe with buttonless tops and with shoes that didn’t need to be tied. The trick to peeling an orange with only one hand, she discovered, was to hold it with your feet. She moved on to confront what for her was a rather more significant challenge: how can you surf with only one arm?`),
    paragraph(`On the day before Thanksgiving—only twenty-six days after the attack—Hamilton gave surfing a try and quickly made some important discoveries. The first was that she would have to modify the paddling technique she used to get her board out where the waves were. The second was that she would have to change the way she moved from a prone position to a standing position on the board. Most surfers, including Hamilton before the attack, put their hands palm down on the board next to their ribs and then push their abdomen up. She experimented and found that she could place her one hand in the center of the board and push. Once up, she found it wasn’t too hard to balance using only one arm. After a few falls, she successfully rode a wave and thereby silenced the voice of doubt in her mind that had insisted she would never surf again. She celebrated this triumph by shedding tears of joy.`),
    paragraph(`Hamilton subsequently returned to competitive surfing and in 2005, less than two years after the attack, won the National Scholastic Surfing Association National Championship. Shortly thereafter, she turned pro, winning the first contest she entered and many more after that. She also became a media sensation, appearing on 20/20, Inside Edition, and Oprah. She was okay with all this attention, since it gave her a platform for sharing with others her belief in God. It also allowed her to act as role model for those who, like herself, had experienced significant setbacks.`),
    paragraph(`BETHANY HAMILTON WAS ATTACKED by a shark. Alison Botha, a twenty-seven-year-old living in South Africa, was attacked by two men.4 Late on the night of December 18, 1994, she was parking her car near her home when a man reached through the open window and put a knife to her throat. He ordered her to move to the passenger seat, then got into the car and drove them away. Shortly thereafter he picked up a second man, and they drove into the countryside.`),
    paragraph(`The car came to a stop at a deserted spot. One of the men raped her and then, after a pause, savagely attacked her, stabbing her thirty-seven times in the abdomen and pubic region, and slashing her throat seventeen times. The two men then drove off, leaving her for dead—except that she wasn’t. In a stunned state, Botha dragged herself to the road, where she would have a better chance of getting help. Doing so was difficult because her windpipe had been severed and her intestines were falling out of her abdomen.`),
    paragraph(`One car came along, but when the driver saw her naked, bloody body, it just kept going. Fortunately for Botha, the next car did stop. A young man named Tiaan Eilerd called for an ambulance and did his best to stanch the bleeding. When the ambulance finally arrived at the hospital—more than two hours later—the medical personnel there were astonished by the brutality of the attack. They were also amazed that she was still alive. Police were subsequently able to track down Botha’s attackers, who were tried, found guilty, and given lengthy prison sentences.`),
    paragraph(`Botha’s recovery was long and painful, and during it, she became depressed. Things turned around, though, when she got an invitation to tell her story to an audience. She discovered that by sharing this story, she could make a positive difference in the lives of other people, many of whom had themselves experienced major or even traumatic setbacks. Before long, she was in demand as an inspirational speaker.`),
    paragraph(`In her talks, she described the philosophy by which she lives: “We cannot always control what happens in our life . . . , but we can always control what we do with what happens.”5 It is a strategy that Stoic philosopher Epictetus would have applauded. Botha had come to realize that she had it in her power to choose whether to respond to the attack with anger, and she thereupon decided not to, knowing that anger has the power to devour those who experience it.`),
    paragraph(`Botha subsequently married, and nine years after the attack, much to her surprise, she got pregnant. Her doctors had assumed that the wounds to her abdomen had destroyed her reproductive system, making biological motherhood impossible, but this turned out not to be the case. Tiaan Eilerd, the man who had rescued her after her assault, was there in the delivery room. His earlier encounter with Botha had inspired him to go into medicine, and he was now a doctor.`),
    paragraph(`ROGER EBERT WAS MOVIE CRITIC for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he also became cohost of PBS’s Sneak Previews show. He was thriving, both professionally and personally. And then in 2002, he was diagnosed with salivary cancer. He was treated for it, but the cancer returned. Doctors treated it again, and things were looking hopeful, but then his carotid artery burst. He barely survived the episode. It subsequently ruptured six more times. In the end, as a result of all these ruptures, all the cancer, and all the surgery, Ebert lost the ability to speak. Not only that, but the reconstructive surgery done on his jaw left him looking like a caricature. His face had a permanent, cartoon-like grin, with its mouth hanging open.`),
    paragraph(`In March 2011, Ebert gave a TED Talk.6 More precisely, he sat in silence on the stage while a computerized speech synthesizer read from a script he had previously prepared. After a minute, his wife and some friends started similarly speaking on his behalf. (Ebert had worried that if his computer did the entire talk, people would be lulled to sleep by its voice.) While the others read his words, Ebert used gestures to make jokes, usually at his own expense. The audience at first was unsure how to react but soon figured out that although Ebert had lost his ability to speak, he had not lost his sense of humor. They laughed, and when the talk was over, they gave him a standing ovation. It was a remarkable and touching performance, and in giving it, what courage Ebert had displayed! He died two years later, at age seventy.`),
    paragraph(`Watching the video of Ebert’s talk reminded me how easy it is for us to take our abilities for granted. At some point in his decline, Ebert must have uttered his last words, but in his lecture he said he couldn’t remember what they were. This, however, is understandable. All his life, he could safely assume that the words he spoke would be followed by other words, so he had no need to remember them. This time turned out to be different, though.`),
    paragraph(`It struck me that I, too, will someday utter my last words; indeed, there is a long-shot chance that I have already uttered them. More generally, for everything I do, there will be a last time I do it. You might think these are dark and depressing thoughts, but they can have just the opposite effect. They can help us transform our ability to speak from something we take completely for granted into what it in fact is—something remarkable and precious.`),
    paragraph(`Many, on hearing Ebert’s story, would use the word unlucky to describe him, but a much more fitting word would be unvanquished. During the last decade of his life, he experienced enough setbacks for several lifetimes and yet was not embittered by his fate. It was a triumph of the human spirit.`),
    paragraph(`WHEREAS EBERT HAD LOST his ability to speak, many others have lost their ability to move. Lou Gehrig was one of the greatest baseball players ever to live. During the twelve seasons between 1926 and 1937, he batted .300 or above, and in 1934 he batted a remarkable .363. In the 1938 season, he fell off this pace a bit and batted “only” .295. He complained about feeling tired. When he showed up for spring training in 1939, he had clearly lost his coordination and power. This was visible in his hitting and base running, as well as in his muddled attempts to catch the ball.`),
    paragraph(`Sports writers speculated about what had happened to him. His coaches considered benching him, but their respect for him made this impossible. Finally, on May 2, 1939, Gehrig benched himself “for the good of the team.” When the stadium announcer told the fans that Gehrig would not be playing in that day’s game, ending his record of appearing in 2,130 consecutive games, the audience gave him a standing ovation. Meanwhile Gehrig sat in the dugout, teary-eyed.`),
    paragraph(`On June 19, his thirty-sixth birthday, Gehrig was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis—commonly known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease—and on June 21 the Yankees announced his retirement. On July 4, which had been proclaimed Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, Gehrig gave his famous farewell speech: “For the past two weeks you have been reading about the bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.” He went on to thank his fans, his fellow players, his coach, the groundskeepers, his mother-in-law (who sided with him in squabbles with her own daughter), his parents (who educated him and gave him a strong body), and his wife (who showed “more courage than you dreamed existed”). “I might have been given a bad break,” he concluded, “but I’ve got an awful lot to live for.”7`),
    paragraph(`And Gehrig did live on for another two years. During that time, he experienced setback after setback, as abilities were stripped from him. He later wrote that “I intend to hold on as long as possible and then if the inevitable comes, I will accept it philosophically and hope for the best. That’s all we can do.” Although there is no evidence that Gehrig had read the Stoics, he appears to have been a fine example of what I call a congenital Stoic: he seems to have known instinctively what the Stoic philosophers had figured out two thousand years earlier.`),
    paragraph(`THE THEORETICAL PHYSICIST STEPHEN HAWKING was afflicted by Lou Gehrig’s disease in 1963, at age twenty-one. Like Gehrig, he had to watch ability after ability disappear. When he could no longer walk, he got around at first in a regular wheelchair and then in a motorized wheelchair that he could steer by moving a joystick with his fingers. When he could no longer control his hand, he steered with his cheek muscles. Early on, he could communicate by talking, but as years went by, his speech devolved into mumbling. Then a bout of pneumonia forced doctors to do a tracheotomy, which deprived him of even his mumbles. He overcame this setback by raising his eyebrows to pick out, with the aid of an assistant, letters on a card and thereby spell out words.`),
    paragraph(`Because of his celebrity status in the world of science, Hawking had lots of help in dealing with the setbacks he faced. His physicist friends put him in touch with engineers and programmers, who set up a system by which he could type computer messages using a clicker. This was enhanced by the addition of a speech synthesizer that could read those messages aloud. In 1997 Gordon Moore, cofounder of Intel, encountered Hawking at a conference and put his employees to work improving the setup Hawking was using. Other disabled individuals have benefited from the resulting technologies, so Hawking’s setback had a silver lining for humanity. Many setbacks do, especially if the person set back is resilient.`),
    paragraph(`Despite his disabilities, Hawking was able to do interviews and give lectures. In these events, it may have looked like what he said was coming directly from his brain, but this was an illusion. The sentences were all previously composed. When he “spoke,” the computer was reading from a manuscript, one sentence at a time. Even though Hawking was British, the speech synthesizer he used, because of its American origins, had an American accent. It also sounded very robotic. Other, more sophisticated voices became available, but Hawking wisely stayed with the voice that had become, as far as the world was concerned, his voice.`),
    paragraph(`Gehrig’s setback was in various respects more challenging than Hawking’s. Because he was a gifted athlete, Gehrig’s physical abilities lay at the core of his self-concept. By losing these abilities, he was losing an important part of his identity. Hawking’s self-identity, by contrast, centered on his mental abilities, and he retained them despite the deterioration of his body. Also, Hawking benefited from technological breakthroughs that were unavailable to Gehrig. Nevertheless, both men bravely met a challenge that would have defeated many. That is why we admire them, even if we are indifferent to baseball and are clueless when it comes to the physics of black holes.`),
    paragraph(`YOU MIGHT THINK THAT Gehrig and Hawking would represent worst-case scenarios, but you would be mistaken. Consider, in particular, those individuals who have locked-in syndrome. Although their minds are still active, they have lost all muscular control except, maybe, in their eyelids. And as medical setbacks go, this one is sudden. You are in the prime of life, going about your everyday business, when you start feeling strange. You pass out, and when you wake up, days or weeks later, you are in a hospital. You can still see and hear, but you can’t move a muscle, meaning you can’t ask questions. This is because you have experienced a stroke in your brain stem. It has severed communications between your brain and your body, without otherwise affecting that brain and body.`),
    paragraph(`This is what happened to high school teacher Richard Marsh. He awoke in a hospital, attached to a respirator. His doctors, who assumed he was brain dead, felt free to have conversations about him in his presence. At one point, they told his wife that he had only a 2 percent chance of surviving, and that if he did survive, he would be a vegetable. Did she want them to turn off the ventilator? Richard Marsh screamed no!—internally, that is. He could not move any of his muscles, including the ones that would let him speak. Fortunately, his wife declined the offer, and as a result, Marsh walked out of the hospital four months after his stroke.8`),
    paragraph(`As locked-in patients go, Marsh was lucky. Jean-Dominique Bauby, the forty-three-year-old editor-in-chief of French Elle magazine, had a brain stem stroke, and when he woke up in a hospital, he could not move any part of his body except for two things: he could slowly swivel his head, and he could blink his left eye. Because he could not blink his right eye, there was danger that its cornea would dry out and ulcerate. To prevent this from happening, doctors sewed shut the lids of that eye.`),
    paragraph(`Bauby could not swallow, meaning he could not eat or drink anything, so he had to be fed through a tube that passed into his stomach. Imagine it: he could still smell french fries but could not eat them. He could remember the last meal he ate but knew he probably would never have that meal again—or any other meal, for that matter. His inability to swallow had another consequence. He could not do something that you do all day long, albeit unconsciously—namely, swallow the saliva that continually flows into your mouth. As a result, he tended to drool. It is easy, on encountering an immobile, speechless, one-eyed, drooling individual, to assume that he is a vegetable, but Bauby’s mind was still fully functional. Indeed, despite his locked-in condition, he wrote the memoir The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which was made into a 2007 movie of the same name.`),
    paragraph(`He dictated the book with his left eye. Other people would recite the alphabet to him, and when they came to the letter he wanted, he would blink. He found that some people, rather than patiently going through the alphabet, would anticipate the letter or word he was trying to communicate, but this only slowed things down. A good translator would let him finish words and sentences. Because editing those sentences was such a laborious process, he carefully composed them in his mind before dictating them.`),
    paragraph(`Bauby doesn’t seem to have been a practicing Stoic before he became locked in. He did write, though, about “acquiring stoicism” as a mechanism for coping with his setback.9 Unlike Marsh, Bauby did not walk out of the hospital. He died in 1997, fifteen months after his stroke—and two days after the French publication of his memoir.`),
    paragraph(`Realize that Bauby’s situation, although bad, could have been worse. Patients with total locked-in syndrome can’t even move their eyelids, making it difficult for doctors to discover that their mind is still functioning, and if it is, making it impossible to communicate with them. But such cases have a ray of hope. Technological breakthroughs have made it possible for locked-in patients to communicate with thought alone. Electrodes implanted in their brain send signals to a computer. By this means, a patient can pick out letters on a computer screen. The process is very slow, though: one woman patient was able to “type” at the rate of one or two words per minute—and felt delighted to be able to do so.10 I have found it useful, when my word processor is balky, to contemplate her predicament.`),
    paragraph(`In his autobiography, Theodore Roosevelt offered this bit of Stoic-inspired advice: “Do what you can, with what you’ve got, where you are.”11 This is precisely what the locked-in individuals I have described did. They were thereby able to transform what might otherwise have been characterized as tragic lives into lives that were both courageous and admirable.`),
    paragraph(`AS ONE LAST EXAMPLE OF RESILIENCE in the face of a setback, consider the case of the Stoic philosopher Paconius Agrippinus, who in around 67 BCE was openly critical of Emperor Nero. A messenger came to inform him that he was being tried in the Senate. His response: “I hope it goes well, but it is time for me to exercise and bathe, so that is what I will do.” Subsequently, another messenger appeared with the news that he had been found guilty of treasonous behavior and condemned. “To banishment or to death?” he asked. “To banishment,” the messenger replied. Agrippinus responded with a question: “Was my estate at Aricia taken?” “No,” said the messenger. “In that case,” said Agrippinus, “I will go to Aricia and dine.”12`),
    paragraph(`In behaving in this manner, Agrippinus was simply applying advice that, although perfectly sensible, is easy to forget. When the number of options available is limited, it is foolish to fuss and fret. We should instead simply choose the best of them and get on with life. To behave otherwise is to waste precious time and energy.`),
    paragraph(`Setback stories like those related above leave me with curiously mixed emotions. On hearing them, I might be moved to tears, but at the same time, I might feel ashamed of myself for taking so much of my life for granted. In the course of going about my daily business, I might experience a minor setback, like discovering that all the parking spaces close to the grocery store have been taken. Oh, great! I might think, only to recall that in walking the few more steps that I was complaining about, I was living the life that Stephen Hawking or Jean-Dominique Bauby could only dream of. Shame on me!`),
    paragraph(`Although setback stories can sadden and shame us, they can also be enormously uplifting. In them, we encounter ordinary people who have experienced setbacks vastly more challenging than any we are likely to experience, and who, instead of wallowing in self-pity, responded with courage and intelligence. They thereby transformed what could have been personal tragedy into personal triumph.`)
