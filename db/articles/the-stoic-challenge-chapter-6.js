    paragraph(`In 1974 the psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman did an experiment that made use of a wheel of fortune.1 It looked like any number between 1 and 100 could come up on their wheel, but in fact it was rigged: only number 10 and number 65 could come up. The wheel was spun one time in the presence of experimental subjects, who were then asked, first, whether the percentage of African nations in the United Nations was higher or lower than the number that came up on the wheel, and second, what they thought the correct percentage was.`),
    paragraph(`Subjects who got 10 as their wheel number guessed, on average, that 25 percent of the nations in the UN were African, whereas those who got 65 as their wheel number guessed 45 percent. This is very strange behavior, since the number that comes up on the wheel obviously has no connection whatsoever with the percentage of African nations in the UN. And yet the wheel number they got had clearly affected their guesses. (In 1974, 36 percent of the nations in the UN were African.)`),
    paragraph(`In a variant of this experiment, the psychologists Fritz Strack and Thomas Mussweiler divided experimental subjects into two groups.2 Those in the first were asked whether Mahatma Gandhi was over or under 9 years of age when he died and were then asked to guess his age at death. Their average guess was 50. Those in the second group were asked whether Gandhi was over or under 140 years of age when he died and were then asked to guess his age at death. Their average guess was 67, which is 17 years older than the first group guessed. Obviously, Gandhi had to have died after age 9 in order to accomplish all the things he did, and obviously he died before age 140, since no one lives that long. It is therefore surprising that asking the experimental subjects the over-under questions could have such an impact on their guesses about how old he was—and yet it did. (Gandhi in fact died at 78.)`),
    paragraph(`These examples illustrate what has become known as the anchoring effect. In Kahneman and Tversky’s experiment, the rigged wheel sank an “anchor” into the subconscious minds of their research subjects, and on lodging there, it affected their subsequent speculations about the world. In Strack and Mussweiler’s experiment, the over-under question about Gandhi’s age played a similar role. In both experiments, a subject’s conscious mind lacked sufficient information to make a rational guess, but instead of admitting its ignorance, it yielded the floor to the subject’s subconscious mind, which was happy to hazard one. Those guesses, though, were distorted by the anchors that had been sunk into the subject’s subconscious mind.`),
    paragraph(`Businesses use anchoring to sell their goods and services. Suppose a clothing store has a shipment of shirts to sell, and the store manager has two retailing options. Plan A is to price the shirts at $32 each. Plan B is to price them at $40 but to have frequent 20-percent-off sales. In either case, consumers will have access to the shirts at $32, but Plan B has the psychological advantage of sinking a $40 “regular-price anchor” into shoppers’ subconscious minds. As a result, when the shirts go on sale, customers will have the impression that they are getting a $40 shirt for only $32. This impression will trigger in them a desire to purchase additional shirts, and these added sales, together with a small number of full-price sales3 at $40 per shirt, means that overall, Plan B will be substantially more profitable than Plan A.`),
    paragraph(`THE ANCIENT STOIC PHILOSOPHERS were way ahead of these psychologists and businessmen. They employed the anchoring phenomenon not to sell shirts but to have a more fulfilling life. In particular, they would periodically make a point of imagining ways in which their lives could be worse. This might sound like a recipe for a miserable existence, but was in fact quite the opposite. By thinking about how things could be worse, they effectively sank an anchor into their subconscious minds (not that they thought in these psychological terms). The presence of that anchor affected how they subsequently felt about their current situation. Instead of comparing it to the superior situations they routinely found themselves dreaming of, they compared it to the inferior situations they imagined and thereupon concluded that things weren’t so bad.`),
    paragraph(`This process, now known as negative visualization, is one of the most remarkable psychological instruments in the Stoic tool kit. It is important to realize that in advising us to negatively visualize, the Stoics weren’t advocating that we dwell on how things could be worse; that would indeed be a recipe for misery. Instead, what we should do is periodically have flickering thoughts about how our lives and circumstances could be worse.`),
    paragraph(`As an exercise in negative visualization, imagine that you receive a phone call telling you that a close friend has passed away. Give yourself a few seconds for this possibility to sink in. Accompany this thought with a mental image of, say, attending that friend’s funeral. This provides the visual component of the negative visualization. Now return to your daily business. There is a very good chance that when you next encounter this friend, you will experience a little burst of delight in her continued existence. This is because you will, if only for a time, have stopped taking that existence for granted.`),
    paragraph(`As another exercise in negative visualization, close your eyes for a few seconds and imagine that you have lost your color vision. Try to imagine a shades-of-gray world. Now open your eyes and inspect your environment. You will likely do so with an altered state of mind. You will start to see—really see—the colors that you have been seeing all your life, and you will likely be glad to see them. You will, if only for a time, be grateful that you don’t live in the colorless world of a color-blind person.`),
    paragraph(`Those who are color-blind obviously won’t be able to do this visualization, but not to worry—here is another exercise. Imagine that you are not just color-blind but blind, period. Imagine that you live in a world of darkness, in which you never see a rose or the face of a loved one. Or instead of simply imagining it, why not live it for a while? As an extension of this exercise, close your eyes and see how long you can keep them closed. When you open them again, you will likely feel a rush of gratitude.`),
    paragraph(`And if you happen to be not just color-blind but completely blind, you can still benefit from negative visualization. You are presumably reading this book in Braille or listening to a recording of it. Imagine, though, that you were instead living in the time before Braille and sound recording existed. Under these circumstances, you would have to find someone willing to read books to you; otherwise, you will be cut off from the world of literature. But you aren’t living in that time. Again, aren’t you lucky?`),
    paragraph(`Besides thinking about how much worse off you would be if you lost something, you can think about how much worse off you would be if you never had it to begin with. Along these lines, consider the situation of Marcia, a first-century Roman woman who was still profoundly grieving the death of her son after three years. Seneca’s advice to her: rather than mourning the end of his life, she should be thankful that her son was able to play a role in her life for as long as he did.4`),
    paragraph(`YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE BRILLIANT to practice negative visualization; nor do you need hours of time. To the contrary, you can practice it, for only a few seconds, practically anywhere, and at zero financial cost. That such a basic technique could be so powerful is amazing. Consider it a gift to mankind from the (imaginary) Stoic gods.`),
    paragraph(`It is likewise amazing that such a powerful technique could be so easy to learn. You need not study with a guru on a distant mountaintop, nor practice for years to become proficient. Indeed, by reading the last few paragraphs—seated, I hope, in a comfortable chair—you have learned all you need to know to benefit from the technique. You may even have already benefited from it by doing the exercises I provided.`),
    paragraph(`It is easy to take what we have for granted. Consequently, after a long period in which nothing bad happens, a practicing Stoic might become complacent and forget to do negative visualization. This has happened to me on many occasions. Fortunately for us, the Stoic gods have a way of getting us to think about how things could be worse: they show us how they could be worse by presenting us with setbacks. In doing this, they are actually doing us a favor, since a setback, if we deal with it in the proper frame of mind, is likely to trigger in us a renewed appreciation of our life and circumstances.`),
    paragraph(`With a bit of effort and cleverness, you can find a bright lining to almost any cloud you encounter. Almost regardless of how bad things are, they could be worse, and this alone is reason to give thanks.`)
