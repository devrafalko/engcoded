    paragraph(`You are a divided being, in the sense of having both a mind and a body. Furthermore, your mind itself is divided into a conscious and a subconscious component. Because of the front-and-center nature of your conscious mind, you are thoroughly familiar with its operations. The same cannot be said, though, of your subconscious mind.`),
    paragraph(`To gain evidence of your subconscious mind’s existence, along with insight into its operations, perform the zazen meditation. Find a quiet place where you can sit—or better still, lie down—for five minutes. During that time, close your eyes and think of nothing—try, that is, to stop thinking. You will find this exceedingly difficult to do. Ideas will keep popping into your conscious mind, which is to say that your subconscious mind will keep planting them there.`),
    paragraph(`Whereas your conscious mind is conspicuously rational, your subconscious mind operates in a semirational manner. It is capable of coming up with crazy ideas: consider your dreams. It is also susceptible to a variety of unsavory influences. When, for example, you buy something you don’t need, it is likely because an advertiser successfully planted an idea in your subconscious mind, which in turn persuaded your conscious mind to make the purchase.`),
    paragraph(`You might think that your conscious mind, thanks to its rational nature, would be in charge, but this is not the case. To the contrary, your conscious mind appears to be perfectly willing to play the role of lackey to your subconscious mind. For example, instead of using its reasoning ability to figure out a way to reduce your burdensome mortgage payments, your conscious mind might spend its time coming up with a clever way to finance the extravagant car that your subconscious mind is convinced you can’t live without.`),
    paragraph(`And what is the source of your subconscious mind’s power? Stated simply, it doesn’t fight fair. If your conscious mind comes up with a sensible reason to dismiss its suggestion, your subconscious mind will simply suggest it again—and again and again. This is why you might find yourself eating a second piece of cake after dinner when, truth be told, you didn’t even need the first piece. It is also why, after being talked into having one beer, you might find yourself thirsty for another. The alcohol in the first beer will affect your brain in a way that diminishes your conscious mind’s ability to withstand the nagging of your subconscious mind, and as a result, you will find yourself wanting “just one more.”`),
    paragraph(`Alternatively, your subconscious mind will sneakily wait until you have gone to bed to present you with an idea. You might put that idea out of your (conscious) mind so you can sleep, only to have it pop back in. As a result, by the time the sun rises, your sleep-deprived conscious mind might have capitulated: it will do whatever your subconscious mind wants, just to shut it up.`),
    paragraph(`WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE A SETBACK, your subconscious mind goes to work trying to fathom its cause, and it is inclined to point an accusing finger: it looks for another person as the cause and likes to attribute sinister motives to that person. More generally, your subconscious mind tends to treat life’s setbacks as undeserved tribulations. It therefore tries to convince you that you have been wronged. Shortly thereafter—unless you take steps to prevent it—your emotions will rise in support of your subconscious mind’s interpretation of events. But whereas your subconscious mind likes to nag your conscious mind into submission, your emotions shout their demands. As a result, in the aftermath of a setback, you might, much to your surprise, find yourself shouting at the person your subconscious mind has accused.`),
    paragraph(`When you experience a setback, your conscious mind can therefore become the target of a double attack—a crossfire, as it were—directed by your subconscious mind and assisted by your emotions. Under these circumstances, your conscious mind will struggle to think clearly, and as a result, you might end up with a second-rate workaround to your setback. And even worse, once your emotions are triggered, they are hard to subdue, so they may continue to disrupt your life long after the setback that triggered them has been overcome. Dealing with your emotions and your subconscious mind, I should add, is a lifelong challenge, since unlike any children you might have, your emotions and subconscious mind are never going to grow up.`),
    paragraph(`YOU MAY RESENT THE ROLE that your emotions and subconscious mind play in your life. They interfere with your ability to cope with the world and thereby make your days more challenging than they need to be. You may also imagine that the ancient Stoics, being eminently rational—they were among the world’s first logicians—would have tried to extinguish the operation of the subconscious mind and throttle the emotions. But they did no such thing.`),
    paragraph(`They realized, to begin with, that there is an upside to having a subconscious mind. It can, for example, read body language and facial expressions in a way that is very difficult to put into words. As a result, it can give you a gut feeling that someone is not to be trusted and might thereby prevent you from being exploited. Your subconscious mind also has a moral sense. It turns out that many heroic rescues are triggered not by rational analysis—there simply isn’t time for it—but rather by a gut moral instinct about what must be done under certain circumstances.1 Your subconscious mind is also the source of most of your creative insights. Artists, writers, mathematicians, scientists, and inventors rely heavily on their subconscious mind for breakthrough ideas.2 Your subconscious mind is where your muse, if you have one, resides.`),
    paragraph(`That the subconscious mind could provide mathematicians, scientists, and inventors with insights suggests that besides having a wild imagination, it has the ability to reason. And indeed it does, but in a different way than your conscious mind reasons. In particular, your subconscious mind is quite willing to engage in lateral thinking and to explore unlikely connections between ideas, something that your sober and methodical conscious mind is reluctant to do.`),
    paragraph(`The Stoics weren’t anti-emotion; indeed, they placed a high value on positive emotions, including delight, joy, and a sense of awe. They knew that without these emotions, ours would be a gray existence—and probably pointless as well. At the same time, though, they were intent on reducing the number of negative emotions they experienced, including frustration, anger, grief, and disappointment.`),
    paragraph(`This is why they came up with what I am calling the Stoic test strategy. To employ it, we assume that the setbacks we experience are not simply undeserved tribulations but tests of our ingenuity and resilience, administered by imaginary Stoic gods. To pass these tests, we must not only come up with effective workarounds to setbacks but must also, while doing so, avoid the onset of negative emotions.`),
    paragraph(`By treating a setback as a Stoic test, we take our subconscious mind out of the setback-response loop. More precisely, we preclude it from suggesting a finger-pointing explanation for a setback, an explanation that assumes that someone else is taking advantage of us or abusing us. This prevents the activation of our emotions, which not only dramatically lowers the personal cost of being set back but also improves our chances of dealing with the setback in a thoughtful manner.`),
    paragraph(`If this were all the Stoic test strategy accomplished, it would be worth our while to employ it in response to a setback. If we are clever in our use of the strategy, though, we can find ourselves not only avoiding negative emotions but also experiencing positive ones, including pride, satisfaction, and maybe even joy, as we rise to meet the challenge the setback represents. The Stoics, in other words, came up with a strategy for turning the setback lemons that life hands us into lemonade—or maybe even a lemon meringue pie.`),
    paragraph(`The discovery and development of the Stoic test strategy is clearly one of the Stoics’ greatest accomplishments. In the remainder of this book, I will develop this strategy in greater detail and explore its use. First, however, it will be useful to familiarize ourselves with two psychological phenomena, anchoring and framing, that lie at the heart of the Stoic test strategy. They were “discovered” in the late twentieth century, two millennia after the Stoics put them to work in their lives and philosophy.`)
