    paragraph(`Robots may soon be more sensitive than humansâ€”at least when it comes to their skin. Researchers from Glasgow University have developed a type of artificial skin that is more sensitive than our own. Just add this to all the ways robots are taking over the world.`),
    header(`The Skin You're In`),
    paragraph(`Dr. Ravinder Dahiya is the creator of this new "electronic" skin. As he told TedX Glasgow in an interview, it uses a variety of sensors to measure things like pressure and temperature. Dahiya and his team managed to create this extremely sensitive artificial skin using graphene, a material that "despite being just a single atom thick, is stronger than steel, electrically conductive, and transparent," according to a press release. `),
    paragraph(`The extreme sensitivity of the new skin could lead to better prosthetics, where touch is currently a limiting factor. (Watch this cool demonstration that shows just how important touch sensitivity is.) The artificial skin also has a solar panel underneath that absorbs 98 percent of available light, making the entire device self-powered.`),
    header(`The Future is (Almost) Here`),
    paragraph(`The coupling of solar panel technology with artificial skin is a huge breakthrough, but Dahiya and his team aren't stopping there. They hope to bring cheaper prosthetics to market, and eventually create "an entirely energy-autonomous prosthetic limb," Dahiya told Engadget.`),
    paragraph(`Down the line, that may mean smarter, more sensitive robots. "Skin capable of touch sensitivity also opens the possibility of creating robots capable of making better decisions about human safety," Dahiya explained in the Glasgow University press release. "A robot working on a construction line, for example, is much less likely to accidentally injure a human if it can feel that a person has unexpectedly entered their area of movement and stop before an injury can occur." Welcome to the future.`),
