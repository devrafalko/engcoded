    paragraph(`In his essay “On Providence,” Seneca quotes the Cynic philosopher Demetrius as saying, “Nothing seems to me more unhappy than the man who has no experience of adversity.” Consequently, he says, a wise man will welcome a degree of adversity into his life. He will regard this adversity as a kind of training exercise and might even take delight in it, “just as brave soldiers delight in warfare.” Not only that, but in the absence of adversity, a wise man will become restless. “Some men,” he says, “have presented themselves of their own accord to misfortune when it is slow to afflict them, seeking to find an opportunity for their worth to shine out when it is in danger of falling into obscurity.”1 This may sound strange, but a wise man knows that although adversity can crush us, it can also, if we are in the right frame of mind, strengthen us and thereby enhance our ability to withstand adversity.`),
    paragraph(`Once we start thinking of setbacks as Stoic tests, we may discover that instead of dreading them, we look forward to them. Besides giving us a chance to develop our skill in dealing with them, setbacks give us an opportunity to display the skill we have thus far developed. Much as a tennis player can take pride in her playing ability, we can take pride in our ability, when set back, to find a good workaround without becoming angry, anxious, or despondent. It is a wonderful skill to possess—and one that relatively few people do possess.`),
    paragraph(`A tennis player will work hard training for games. She will spend hours in strength and fitness training, doing drills, and playing practice matches, all so she will be at the top of her game when she sets foot on the court for a real match. In similar fashion, you can train for life’s setbacks. The training consists in dealing with what might be thought of as practice setbacks, but clarification is in order.`),
    paragraph(`For an event to count as a setback, in the strict sense of the word, we can’t know that it is going to take place. It’s true that we can inadvertently set ourselves back—by forgetting to put gas in the car before we get onto the freeway, for example—but we can’t set ourselves back on purpose, since setbacks require the element of surprise. What we can do, however, is put ourselves into circumstances in which challenging surprises are likely to occur.`),
    paragraph(`If we choose to spend a quiet weekend at home, it is possible, but rather unlikely, that we will experience a setback; if we do, it is likely to be minor, like discovering we’re out of shampoo. If we instead choose to spend that weekend taking a twenty-mile hike through a wilderness area, we are likely to experience a number of interesting setbacks. Consequently, going on a hike can count as a form of setback training, with the setbacks we experience counting as practice setbacks. By dealing with them, we can improve our skill at coming up with workarounds, and at staying calm as we do so.`),
    paragraph(`ONE OF THE BEST WAYS to “study for” Stoic tests is to embark on what I am going to call a Stoic adventure. In such an adventure, we go out of our way to put ourselves into challenging circumstances—circumstances, that is, in which we are likely to be unpleasantly surprised.`),
    paragraph(`Since different people have different life experiences, what counts as a challenge will vary from person to person. For someone who has led a pampered existence, an adventure might involve doing without, for a time, the people who normally take care of her. For her, making breakfast might count as an adventure. For Michael Jordan, it was an adventure to step away from his career as one of the greatest basketball players in history in order to become, for a time, a minor-league baseball player. And for the Moroccan-born French comedian Gad Elmaleh, it was an adventure to move to America and try to do stand-up comedy—in English.`),
    paragraph(`A Stoic adventurer, in the sense I have in mind, might try to acquire a new skill. Some of the adventures I undertook on becoming a Stoic were to take banjo lessons and a course in Italian. I later used these adventures as the basis for new adventures: I gave a banjo recital, and I traveled to Italy. Each adventure presented me with its own challenges and affected my life in surprising ways.`),
    paragraph(`One of my most consequential adventures after becoming a Stoic, though, was learning how to row. I am at present a serious rower, in the sense that I do something connected with rowing almost every day. I have also become a competitive rower, in the sense that I enter regattas in which I compete against other rowers. That said, I should add that I am not a very good rower. I have the wrong body type for rowing, and to be good at it, I would have to train twice as hard—at least!—as I do.`),
    paragraph(`But for me, failing to win races—or even coming in last place in a race—isn’t an issue. My primary objective in rowing is to acquire mettle, not medals. By rowing, I study for Stoic tests. When I am rowing—and even more, when I am racing—unpredictable things happen. An oar might pop out of an oarlock, threatening to capsize my boat. At the start of a race, a passing motorboat might make a wake that partially fills my boat with water, making it even harder to row. And in the sprint to the finish line, another rower might cut in front of me, thereby testing my ability to remain calm and find a workaround, even though I am gasping for air.`),
    paragraph(`ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF ROWING is that it puts me into intimate contact with what I call Lazy Bill.2 This creature lives in my subconscious mind, where it spends most of its time sleeping. When I am rowing, though, it routinely puts in an appearance. I will be straining to do a 500-meter practice sprint, or I will be 3,000 meters into a 5,000-meter race, and Lazy Bill will speak up: “You know, Bill, you could just stop rowing. Think of how much better you would feel if you just stopped rowing!”`),
    paragraph(`It is a voice that on many occasions has seduced me. Most of the time, though, I respond to it by rowing even harder: I’ll show you! Subsequently, I might focus my attention on the number of strokes I have left to complete whatever piece I am rowing and count them off, stroke by stroke. I know that the key to success is to take one more stroke, and then, when I have finished it, take another. By doing this, I can silence and even humiliate Lazy Bill: “You lose, Billy Boy!”`),
    paragraph(`At this point, a word of caution is in order. It is one thing to trash-talk your lazy self, since it is too lazy to do anything about it, but it might be unwise to trash-talk the Stoic gods. Maybe this is just superstition on my part, but then again, they are not only incredibly powerful but are also on the lookout for mortals who are getting bumptious. Best not to take chances.`),
    paragraph(`In daily life, there are many occasions when I could make things easier—in the short run, at least—if I would, metaphorically speaking, “just stop rowing.” But I have found that the achievement of significant goals generally requires me to be able and willing to “take one more stroke,” even though I am dead tired. I’m convinced that it is this ability, as much as any, that allows some people to excel in the challenges they undertake, while other people fail. It is also possible that at some point in my life, my ability to survive will depend on whether I have the fortitude to take just one more breath—and then another. I would like to think that rowing helps me develop this fortitude.`),
    paragraph(`A spectator at a regatta would naturally think that I am rowing against the other rowers. From my Stoic point of view, though, the other rowers are my teammates in a much more important undertaking: my battle against Lazy Bill. I have nothing against winning a race, in the conventional sense of the word, by rowing faster than the other boats that have entered. What really matters to me, though, is that I soundly defeat Lazy Bill.`),
    paragraph(`I am probably not alone in having a lazy self lurking within me; indeed, it is conceivable that you, dear reader, have one as well. In the coming days, be on the lookout for this being, and when it appears, don’t simply capitulate, but consider your options. Experiment with ignoring or even reprimanding it. And ask yourself whether you really want this lowly creature, who has never accomplished anything worthy of note, running your life.`),
    paragraph(`Some readers will be baffled by the foregoing discussion. “What do you mean by my ‘lazy self’?” they will ask. The readers in question will be unable to remember ever having encountered such a being.`),
    paragraph(`Perhaps it is because they have never done anything physically or mentally challenging enough to wake up their lazy self. Or perhaps they are so used to capitulating to its demands that they no longer regard it as an “other” being. Their lazy self has merged with their true self—or should we say, displaced it? Consequently, doing what their lazy self says doesn’t, for them, count as an attack of laziness; it is just life as they know it. How sad!`),
    paragraph(`Although we can’t exterminate our lazy self, we can take steps to limit its control over us. We can, in particular, go out of our way to do things that we find physically or mentally exhausting. This will likely awaken our lazy self, and when it appears, we can slap it down, thereby showing it who is in charge of our life. Yes, confronting our lazy self will require unpleasant effort on our part, but the Stoics would argue that this is a small price to pay in defense of our autonomy.`),
    paragraph(`BY EMBARKING ON STOIC ADVENTURES, you can imbue your life with a heroic aspect, in the sense that the author Joseph Campbell had in mind. The hero’s journey, Campbell wrote, begins with life in the ordinary world, when along comes the call to adventure. In many cases, the call is refused, and the person remains in the ordinary world. But if the call is accepted, he crosses into a special world in which he experiences tests and ordeals—what I call setbacks. If he meets these challenges, he will return to the ordinary world as a transformed being.`),
    paragraph(`Start undertaking Stoic adventures, and you might notice a change in yourself. Formerly when you encountered a setback, you would have responded with feelings of frustration or anger. Now you might experience a little burst of delight: Ahhh! A setback to work on! And if you successfully pass the Stoic test in question, you might experience a deep sense of satisfaction. It is, as I have said, no small feat to beat the Stoic gods at their own game.`),
    paragraph(`One side effect of studying for Stoic tests is that your self-confidence will rise. The more challenges you successfully meet, the more confident you will become of your ability to meet them. By voluntarily dealing with setbacks, you can also improve your ability to spot the silver linings in the gray clouds of daily life, and appreciate just how relatively setback-free your life is.`)
