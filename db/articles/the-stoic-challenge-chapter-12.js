    paragraph(`Because people hate to fail, they are reluctant to admit having done so. Consequently, they conceal their failures not only from other people but from themselves. This is unfortunate, since by not acknowledging a failure, they fail to learn from it, and one failure thereby becomes two.`),
    paragraph(`One way to avoid failure is to spend time and energy anticipating obstacles that can be sidestepped. There is, however, a second, far easier way to avoid failure: make a point of choosing only goals that are easy to attain. Using this strategy, though, will make it almost impossible for us to achieve notable success. Indeed, when we examine the lives of accomplished individuals, we find almost without exception that they pursued goals that were difficult to attain, experienced many failures trying to attain them, and nevertheless pressed on.`),
    paragraph(`This is true in the world of technology. The British inventor James Dyson spent fifteen years developing and rejecting more than five thousand vacuum designs in order to perfect his Dual Cyclone vacuum cleaner. It went on sale in 1993 and was a phenomenal success, transforming the very concept of a vacuum cleaner.`),
    paragraph(`It is true in the world of literature. Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind was rejected by thirty-eight publishers before becoming one of the best-selling books of the twentieth century, and Robert Pirsig’s best-selling Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was rejected by 121 publishers before seeing the light of day. (And in case you are wondering: yes, the book you are now reading was rejected multiple times before finding a home.)`),
    paragraph(`It is true in the world of art. Vincent Van Gogh painted 860 canvases, only one of which sold during his lifetime. His “failed” paintings are now among the best-loved and most expensive around.`),
    paragraph(`It is true even in the world of mathematics. The English mathematician Andrew Wiles spent seven years trying to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. When the breakthrough idea finally came to him, he publicly announced it, only to discover a mistake in his proof. Some mathematicians would have been crushed by this event, but Wiles managed to find a mathematical workaround and thereby bounced back.`),
    paragraph(`Failure would appear to be an essential ingredient of success in the entrepreneurial world. Howard Schultz of Starbucks coffeehouse fame spoke to 242 people in an attempt to raise money to expand Il Giornale, the precursor to Starbucks.1 He says that doing cold-call sales for Xerox taught him how to hear no and keep going.`),
    paragraph(`Kathryn Minshew says that raising startup funding for the Muse, a career development platform, meant having to deal with “a no over breakfast, a no over a 10:30 a.m. coffee, a no over lunch, disinterest at 2 p.m., somebody who left a meeting early at 4, and then I would go to drinks and feel like I was being laughed out of the room.” She had to endure 148 noes to get to a yes.2`),
    paragraph(`Abby Falik is the founder of Global Citizen Year, a not-for-profit organization that sends students abroad for a year of international service between high school and college. She is not only tolerant of hearing noes but is thankful for their existence: “The noes are actually a gift,” she says. Her mentor, she explains, had instructed her to “go out into the world and gather as many noes as you possibly can. It is your homework to be rejected over and over and over and over, and then come back and report on it.” It was, she said, “the most important thing I could have ever done and the most important advice I could have been given.”3 She learned to listen closely to the noes and to mine them for clues. It turns out that noes are a valuable commodity, if you can tolerate hearing them and know what to do with them.`),
    paragraph(`In the rapidly evolving tech industry, failure can be thought of as a key ingredient in product development. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg knows this as well as anyone, and as a result his advice to employees is not “Don’t fail,” but “Fail faster.” They need to forge boldly ahead in their design of a new product, make mistakes, and learn from them so they can go on to make new, better mistakes and ultimately produce successful products.`),
    paragraph(`Failure is also essential to the development of new drugs. Researchers typically spend more than a decade trying and rejecting very many drugs before finding one that meets the FDA’s standards for safety and efficacy. In an attempt to keep his researchers’ morale high in the midst of all this failure, Severin Schwan, CEO of Roche Holding AG, gives champagne lunches to honor research teams whose drug development efforts came up dry. His thinking: “I would argue, from a cultural point of view, it’s more important to praise the people for the nine times they fail than for the one time they succeed.” 4`),
    paragraph(`At this point, readers with Stoical leanings might suggest that our goal in life should be, not to become rich and famous like Schultz and Zuckerberg, but to live a tranquil life, one in which we experience as few negative emotions and as much delight as possible. I quite agree with this suggestion, but two observations are in order. First, as the lives of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius demonstrate, it is possible to achieve “worldly success” while practicing Stoicism. And second, even if we think people like Schultz and Zuckerberg are pursuing the wrong goals, we can nevertheless gain important insights by examining the manner in which they pursue them. They have the ability to try something, fail, learn, and try again. Maybe they were born with these abilities, but more likely they acquired a failure-response strategy that would let them take their failures in stride. Let us now turn our attention to one such strategy.`),
    paragraph(`SUPPOSE YOUR GOAL IS TO succeed at some challenging undertaking. You need to go into it fully realizing that you will likely experience lots of failure. You can substantially reduce the sting of this failure—and thereby increase your chance of eventual success—by engaging in a bit of creative framing: you can, in particular, think of your failures as obstacles rather than setbacks.`),
    paragraph(`To better appreciate this distinction, consider obstacle races. In many of them, athletes are given a map showing the course and its obstacles. At one point, they might have to climb a wall; at another, crawl through a pipe; and at yet another, use a rope to swing across a ditch full of water. Since they know full well the obstacles that lie in wait, it is incorrect to describe them as setbacks, in the strict sense of the word. There is, after all, no element of surprise in encountering them. From a racer’s point of view, cutting a hand while climbing the wall might count as a setback, but encountering the wall itself doesn’t. This distinction between setbacks and obstacles may sound like a quibble, but as we have seen, how we frame a setback has a very real impact on our chances of successfully overcoming it.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose you decide to undertake a personally significant challenge—say, to graduate from college. You can treat your education as the academic equivalent of an obstacle course, and as part of your planning, you can map out the obstacles that lie ahead. You will have to take certain courses, each of which will have its own obstacles: there will be classes to attend, notes to take, readings to do, tests to take, and papers to write. And within these obstacles, there will be yet other obstacles. To write a paper, for example, the first obstacle will be to conduct some research, the next will be to construct an outline, and so on. To prepare for an exam, the first obstacle will be to gather the relevant notes and the second will be to absorb the content of those notes.`),
    paragraph(`To many people, the goal of graduating from college seems daunting. This is part of the reason why in the United States, only one in three people over age twenty-five has accomplished it. To make the dream of becoming a college graduate achievable, it helps to deconstruct your macro-goal of graduating into a long list of mini-goals, such as passing certain classes, that you in turn deconstruct into very long lists of micro-goals, such as completing certain assignments.`),
    paragraph(`The key thing is that each of these micro-goals is eminently doable. Yes, achieving them will require some intelligence, but it is mostly a matter of self-discipline: you’ve just got to make yourself invest the necessary effort. In other words, to accomplish your macro-goal of becoming a college graduate, you don’t need to be a heroic genius; you need only be clever and persistent. You need only do the academic equivalent of taking “one more stroke” in a rowing race.`),
    paragraph(`Similarly, in the business world, you can deconstruct the macro-goal of raising funds for a startup into mini-goals and micro-goals. Think again about Abby Falik, who went out into the world expecting to hear noes, the way runners at the starting line of the 400-meter hurdle race expect to encounter hurdles. On encountering them, she didn’t become despondent. To the contrary, hearing a no meant that she was making progress in the project her mentor had assigned her—namely, to collect noes.`),
    paragraph(`There is, of course, a chance that despite your best efforts, you don’t accomplish the macro-goal of the challenge you’ve undertaken. If this happens, you needn’t hang your head in shame. After all, you did your best, and what more can you do than that? You should also keep in mind that there is something much, much worse than failing to do something difficult, and that is not even attempting to do it because you feared failure.`)
