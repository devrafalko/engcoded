    paragraph(`It seems simplistic, but remembering to say "thank you" can turn your day, your month, or even your year around. It's true (science says so). There's only so much you can control in this world, but counting your blessings has been proven to make a positive difference.`),
    paragraph(`According to a 2003 study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, not only can gratitude make you feel better by reducing toxic emotions, but it can also influence how you take care of your health. In the study, three groups of participants were assigned to keep a journal. One group was instructed to list five things they were grateful for in the past week, another group recorded neutral events, and the last group documented five daily hassles that got in the way of their day. The grateful people in the study reported feeling more optimistic and better about their lives overall, in addition to exercising more and experiencing fewer physical ailments.`),
    paragraph(`Gratitude has other benefits, too. A 2012 study found that gratitude is linked with less aggression, and a 2014 study showed that being grateful helps you make new friends. According to that study, every time you thank a new acquaintance, that person is more likely to seek an ongoing relationship with you.`),
    paragraph(`How can you work on being grateful? Huffington Post shared three ways to kick off the positive vibes: First, keep a daily journal of three things you are thankful for. (Curiosity is thankful for you!) Second, make it a practice to tell a spouse, partner or friend something you appreciate about them every day. And third, look in the mirror each day (perhaps while brushing your teeth) and think of something you like about yourself. In the following videos, watch an uplifting experiment on gratitude and happiness, hear the science behind gratitude, and learn how to give thanks in 31 languages.`),
