    paragraph(`Besides the obvious challenge of finding a workaround for a setback, we face a second challenge: preventing ourselves from experiencing negative emotions in the aftermath of that setback. Many people overlook this second challenge, for the simple reason that they don’t think it is in their power to control their post-setback emotions. Yes, they get upset, angry, or depressed, but that’s just what people do, right?`),
    paragraph(`This attitude is unfortunate for a number of reasons. Getting angry in response to a setback will shatter whatever tranquility we were formerly experiencing. It will also cloud our thinking, making it difficult for our conscious mind to develop possible workarounds. As a result, we will probably end up choosing one that is less than optimal.`),
    paragraph(`Consider two people stuck in adjacent cars in a traffic jam. One responds by getting angry. He curses the other drivers. He calls his wife and tells her how angry he is, quite possibly causing her a degree of distress as well. When he finally gets to work, he is gruff with his co-workers, who might respond by returning the bad attitude.`),
    paragraph(`Another driver, by contrast, quickly realizes that there is nothing he can do to make the traffic move faster. He therefore turns his attention away from the jam and toward the opportunity the delay affords him. As his car sits immobile, he checks his e-mail. He notices a new episode of his favorite podcast, so he starts listening to it. When he arrives at his destination, he is late, but he is in a good mood. If someone asks how the traffic was, he might answer, truthfully and without drama, that it was pretty slow. For this driver, the traffic jam will be nothing more than a small wrinkle in the fabric of his day.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose you are facing the challenge of a burst water pipe in your house or apartment. As a result of the break, you might not have water for your morning shower or coffee. The broken pipe itself, however, is relatively easy to fix. It might take a plumber only twenty minutes to do so, and it might take an accomplished do-it-yourselfer a few hours, including the trip to the hardware store.`),
    paragraph(`But when a water pipe bursts, the ruptured pipe is only one of the problems that confront you. Besides the problem of not having water where you do want it, you have the much bigger problem of having a lot of water where you don’t want it. This unwanted water might flood several rooms, and if the broken pipe is on an upper story, it might cause the lower-story ceiling to collapse. The flooding problem is much more serious than that of the break in the pipe itself. Consequently, when a water pipe bursts, your first response should not be to try to mend the pipe, or to go out and buy drinking water so you can make your morning coffee. It should be to turn off the water supply, to prevent your dwelling from getting flooded.`),
    paragraph(`In parallel manner, when you experience a setback, you are faced with not one challenge but two, and the second—preventing a flood of negative emotions—is usually more critical than the first. This emotional challenge may be secondary in terms of time and causation, but it is often the primary challenge in terms of its impact on us. Usually the harm done us by our emotions—if we allow them to be triggered—is the biggest cost associated with a setback. A sensible person will realize this, and on experiencing a setback, her first response will be to take the steps necessary to prevent the onset of negative emotions. Notice that I didn’t say she will find a way to conceal those emotions; she will prevent them from arising, so there won’t be any negative emotions to conceal.`),
    paragraph(`MANY READERS WILL ADMIT THAT it is stupid to get angry about being stuck in a traffic jam. This anger simply upsets us without having any impact on our situation. Aren’t there cases, though, in which the expression of anger is not just permissible but advisable?`),
    paragraph(`Somewhat surprisingly, Seneca agrees that such cases exist. Suppose you are dealing with someone who has a “sluggish mind” and who therefore doesn’t respond to requests—even those that are perfectly reasonable—unless they are accompanied by a display of anger. It would be understandable, Seneca says, for you to respond to this person’s forwardness with anger, but he has a better idea: respond with feigned anger.1 Doing this will likely achieve the results you are hoping for without making you pay the emotional price of actually getting angry.`),
    paragraph(`Another case in which it might be argued that we should let ourselves experience anger is one in which a grave injustice has been done. In such cases, the anger we experience will be righteous indignation, a very special kind of anger. Indeed, failure to experience righteous indignation might, under some circumstances, be taken as evidence of a flaw in our moral character.`),
    paragraph(`This is an interesting theory, but when we look back in history, we find that it is quite possible to passionately devote ourselves to fighting injustice without our hearts being filled with anger. Consider, for example, Mahatma Gandhi, who fought the unjust treatment of Indians by their British rulers, as well as the unjust treatment of “untouchables” by higher-caste Indians, in a determinedly peaceable manner. Consider also Gandhi admirer Martin Luther King, who fought the injustice of racism. Although King sometimes gave passionate speeches, he does not appear to have been an angry man. Yes, he was capable of experiencing flashes of anger, as any person is, but he apparently did his best to quell them.`),
    paragraph(`In his Autobiography, King told the story of his role in the 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. The boycott in question was triggered by the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to give up her seat to a white man. The whites-only section of the bus was full, and bus rules allowed the driver to expand this section so that subsequently boarding whites would have a seat, even if this deprived blacks of theirs. Furthermore, the whites-only section would be expanded not a seat at a time but a row at a time, in part to spare whites the indignity of having to sit in the same row as a black. Parks and three other blacks were occupying the row of seats just behind the whites-only section, so they were all told to move farther back into the colored section. The other three blacks acceded to the demand, but Parks refused, so the driver had her arrested.`),
    paragraph(`The black community was outraged and decided to boycott Montgomery’s buses. King was chosen as their primary negotiator. In this role, he had to deal with both white racists and outraged blacks. He soon found himself getting angry at people on both sides but quickly regretted doing so: “I knew that this was no way to solve a problem. ‘You must not harbor anger,’ I admonished myself. ‘You must be willing to suffer the anger of the opponent, and yet not return anger. You must not become bitter. No matter how emotional your opponents are, you must be calm.’ ”2`),
    paragraph(`Many of those involved in today’s social change movements equate anger with passion: if you truly care about an injustice, you will be angry about it. They may go on to explain that anger is an effective tool in fights for justice, as it motivates us, and publicly expressed righteous anger gets the attention of the people we are trying to persuade.`),
    paragraph(`This may be true, but as the Stoics well knew, anger is a double-edged sword: besides motivating us, it can exhaust us, so that we run out of energy before winning our battle. Furthermore, the anger we express often triggers anger in those on the other side of an issue. They harden their stance, making compromise less likely. We live in a world in which change, when it comes, is likely to be incremental, meaning that righteous anger can retard progress on the issue in question. And finally, we know that anger can cloud our judgment, causing us to do foolish things and blinding us to possible solutions.`),
    paragraph(`Many social reformers feel so strongly about an issue that they are willing to make personal sacrifices to accomplish their goals. By allowing themselves to get angry, they are clearly sacrificing; anger, as I’ve said, is incompatible with joy. What is less clear is that making these sacrifices will help them achieve their goals; indeed, it might be counterproductive. Social reformers are therefore wise to follow in the footsteps of Gandhi and King, and stay calm while working passionately to bring about change.`),
    paragraph(`SO MUCH FOR ANGER in response to setbacks. What about grief? If someone close to you dies, grief is the natural response. Furthermore, according to Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, grief is the psychologically appropriate response to a personal loss. If we suppress our grief, she says, we increase our chances of experiencing serious mental distress in the future.`),
    paragraph(`Kübler-Ross’s theory of grief has been challenged. The psychologist Robert J. Kastenbaum, for one, has argued that the theory is not sufficiently supported by empirical data.3 Furthermore, even if Kübler-Ross had demonstrated the existence of five stages of grief, it would leave open the question of whether making an effort to go through them is the best way to deal with grief.`),
    paragraph(`George Bonanno, a professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University, argues that we are much more resilient than Kübler-Ross would have us believe and are therefore much less in need of grief counseling than many psychologists recommend—and make a living providing. Indeed, his research indicates that most people, left to themselves, will rebound from an interpersonal loss, and that grief counseling can make things worse by inadvertently undermining their resilience.4`),
    paragraph(`Consider the death of a loved one. Seneca acknowledged that some grief is appropriate in its aftermath—“Nature requires from us some sorrow”—but adds that “more than this is the result of vanity.”5 He has in mind those individuals whose primary motivation for public displays of grief is to show the world how sensitive and caring they are. The Stoics were also aware that in some cases, the anguish a person experiences after a death is motivated more by feelings of guilt than by grief. Suppose a husband takes his wife for granted while she is alive and consequently does not invest as much into their relationship as he should. After she is gone, he can no longer make things right, and this thought sickens him.`),
    paragraph(`The people we love won’t be with us forever—if nothing else, our own death will deprive us of their company. The Stoics therefore recommend that we periodically make a point of reminding ourselves just how wonderful it is that the people we love are currently part of our life. Something could have happened that deprived us of their company, but it didn’t. Aren’t we lucky?`),
    paragraph(`Engage in this kind of “mortality meditation,” say Stoics, and we will fully appreciate the existence of those we love while they are still alive, meaning that our love can make a difference in their lives. We will therefore feel less need, when they are no longer with us, to grieve their passing. In particular, we won’t have regrets about what we could and should have done while they were alive, since we likely would have done it. It should be clear that rather than being ghoulish, these meditations are a deeply life-affirming exercise.`),
    paragraph(`If we presented a Stoic with the list of Kübler-Ross’s five stages of grief, his response would be to skip the first four—denial, anger, bargaining, and depression—and go directly to stage five, acceptance. The Stoic would add that since we don’t have it in our power to resurrect the dead, we are wasting our time mourning their passing excessively. To the extent possible, we should simply accept their death and get on with life.`)
