    paragraph(`As we have seen, when a water pipe bursts, our first priority should be to turn off the water. Only then should we start thinking about cleaning up the mess the water has made, getting the pipe fixed, and getting water for coffee. And the sooner we turn off the water, the better.`),
    paragraph(`In like fashion, when we experience a setback—including those that don’t involve a burst pipe—our first priority should be to prevent ourselves from being flooded by negative emotions. Experiencing such emotions would, after all, make it that much harder for us to find and implement the optimal workaround for the setback. Also, these emotions, once they erupt, can do us more harm than the setback itself does.`),
    paragraph(`The key to successfully implementing the Stoic test strategy is to act fast. In the Introduction, I described my response to a canceled airline flight: as soon as I realized that I would not be sleeping in my own bed that night, I invoked the Stoic test strategy. Had I been slow to do so, my subconscious mind would likely have framed it as an undeserved tribulation, negative emotions would have been triggered, and I probably would have spent that night and part of the next day in an angry, frustrated state of mind. By quickly framing the episode as a test, I could focus my thoughts and energy on finding and implementing the best workaround for the setback. Even more important, I was able to retain my equanimity despite being set back.`),
    paragraph(`Most people are familiar with the conventional “five-second rule.” It says that if food falls on the floor, we can safely eat it as long as we pick it up within five seconds of when it hit the ground. (The reliability of this rule has not, by the way, been established by any recognized medical authority.) Those employing the Stoic test strategy can think in terms of a similar rule: if we are set back, we have five seconds to declare the event to be a Stoic test.`),
    paragraph(`Even though I have been using the Stoic test strategy for years, there are still occasions when, after being set back, I respond by blurting out a profanity—or should I say, something that back in the twentieth century would have counted as one. These outbursts seem to be reflexive, the way it’s reflexive for my knee to jerk when the doctor taps it with that little hammer. Fortunately, such blurting does not seem to prevent me from subsequently being able to employ the Stoic test strategy with success, as long as I do so without delay. And for the record, I have found that the more Stoic tests I take, the less common my setback-related verbal outbursts have become. A sign, perhaps, of Stoic progress?`),
    paragraph(`Besides writing the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote a document that has since become known as “Ten Rules for a Good Life.” One rule is that when someone does something that makes us angry, we should count to ten before we speak—and count to one hundred if we are very angry. The idea is that by counting to ten, our anger will have sufficiently subsided that when we do speak, we won’t blurt out something that we will later regret. Notice, by the way, that it takes about five seconds to count to ten.`),
    paragraph(`There is, however, an important difference between Jefferson’s count-to-ten rule and my Stoic test version of the five-second rule. Jefferson’s rule tells us what to do when we get angry. He is therefore offering damage-control advice. The five-second rule, by contrast, is designed to prevent anger from arising in the first place. In other words, whereas Jefferson was interested in anger management, the Stoics were interested in anger prevention.`),
    paragraph(`IF WE WERE TO GO BACK 500 million years in our extended family tree,1 we would find ancestors with very simple brains that could do little more than control various bodily functions, sense the outside world, and respond reflexively to that sensory input. Move forward 250 million years from that, and we would find animals that had acquired a limbic system that caused some physical experiences (such as eating food or having sex) to feel good and other experiences (such as getting cut or burned) to feel bad. Being incentivized in this manner allowed these animals to move beyond purely reflexive behavior. They could go out of their way to do things that felt good and avoid doing things that felt bad.`),
    paragraph(`Have you ever wondered why orgasms are possible? It is because animals capable of experiencing them were more likely to mate and thereby have offspring than animals that weren’t. Likewise, have you ever wondered why we feel unpleasantly hungry if we go without eating for a long period and why we feel good when we do eat? It is because animals capable of having these feelings were more likely to stay nourished and therefore to survive than those that lacked them. An animal that thought fasting felt great and sex felt awful would have been unlikely to have any descendants. According to evolutionary biologists, this is how we came to possess the wiring that allows us to feel physically good and bad.2`),
    paragraph(`With the passage of many generations, animals’ ability to feel good and bad gained another dimension: besides being able to experience physical feelings, they started experiencing mental feelings—also known as emotions. At first, these emotions were probably negative. Animals might, in particular, have come to fear things that experience told them would feel physically bad: after being bitten by a snake, they might develop a fear of snakes.`),
    paragraph(`With the passage of many more generations, these emotions became more complex. If, for example, animals returned to the place where they had been bitten by a snake, they might experience anxiety, another negative emotion, even though no snake was visible. And besides experiencing negative emotions, they would have started experiencing positive emotions. Suppose, for example, that one of our human ancestors threw a spear at a game animal. If it missed its target, the hunter might have experienced disappointment, a negative emotion, but if the spear found its target, he might have experienced a pleasant feeling of accomplishment.`),
    paragraph(`When their brains developed even further, our ancestors were rewarded for forming and subsequently achieving long-term goals. Each significant step they completed on their way to a goal was rewarded with a feeling of accomplishment, and on achieving their ultimate goal, they were rewarded with one of life’s greatest pleasures, the rush of success. These good feelings were made possible by a release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in their brain.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose that because you are lazy or lack self-confidence, you refuse to undertake difficult challenges. You thereby deprive yourself of the chance to experience the rush of success—unless, that is, you have access to cocaine. A hit of this drug will cause your brain to release copious amounts of dopamine, and as a result, you will experience a high very similar to the one you would experience on, say, sinking the game-winning shot in the championship basketball game. It is, to be sure, a risky and potentially addictive way to obtain this feeling.`),
    paragraph(`Because our ancestors were social animals, their well-being depended on their position within the social hierarchy. This in turn gave rise to social emotions. If someone snubbed them, they might feel humiliated, and if the incident jeopardized their social standing, they might get mad. They also started experiencing envy toward those above them in the hierarchy. These and other social emotions prompted them to behave in a manner likely to improve their social standing and thereby increase their chances of surviving and reproducing.`),
    paragraph(`We inherited our brain and its emotion-generating wiring from these ancestors. The thing to realize is that although we have added processing power to that brain, its basic wiring hasn’t changed much, and as a result, we experience many of the same emotions as they did. Our environment is, however, radically different from theirs. One of their big challenges was getting enough food to eat; one of ours is to avoid getting heart disease as a result of overindulging in cheap and readily available food. They had to worry about getting attacked by animals; we might worry about paying our bills or losing our job. Our brain, then, might be described as a computer with lots of processing power but an archaic operating system. It is our lot in life to be stuck with such a computer.`),
    paragraph(`The ancient Stoics hit on a way to hack that computer. They recognized the human tendency to blame setbacks on someone else and then to get angry at that person. They also realized that if we acted quickly, we could short-circuit this process. In particular, by framing the setback as a test of our resilience and ingenuity, we could not only prevent the onset of negative emotions but transform the setback into a challenge that we might enjoy undertaking. What for most people would simply have been an unpleasant incident might, for us, turn out to be kind of fun.`)
