    paragraph(`I began this book with an airport story, and I will end it with one. In early 2017, as the result of a long and improbable series of events connected with my research on Stoicism, the culture minister of France invited me to attend the opening of an exhibition at the Louvre. Not only was this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but it had an element of adventure, and so I accepted the invitation.`),
    paragraph(`My wife and I flew to Atlanta, where we boarded an overnight flight for what was supposed to be a weekend in Paris. The next morning, in preparation for our arrival in France, I reached for my passport—but it wasn’t where I thought I had put it. I triple-checked my pockets, my carry-on luggage, my seat, and the area around where I was sitting, but nothing turned up. A flight attendant who saw me rummaging asked whether anything was wrong. I explained the passport situation, and she said, “Don’t worry. This happens all the time. It’s here somewhere.” She began a search but had to terminate it because our plane was in its final descent. She said that after the plane landed, we would do a thorough search.`),
    paragraph(`After the other passengers deplaned, the attendant began her search in earnest. She even partially disassembled my airplane seat, but to no avail. At this point, another flight attendant came back, found out what was going on, and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll find it.” She had me empty my pockets (again). She asked if I was wearing a security belt under my clothes. “I already checked it,” I said. “Let’s look again,” she replied, and I awkwardly pulled it out. No passport.`),
    paragraph(`By this time, four other attendants had joined our search. They were poking around and making suggestions, when the plane’s pilot came back to make some suggestions of his own. I was astonished and somewhat discomfited to be the object of so much attention. It was finally decided that I should deplane without my passport and wait nearby. A ground crew, they explained, would do a very thorough cleaning of the plane, and if the passport was there, they would surely find it.`),
    paragraph(`They didn’t. At this point I recognized the handiwork of the Stoic gods. It was a test!`),
    paragraph(`PASSPORTS DON’T JUST VANISH. My theory is that between leaving the top of the jetway in Atlanta—where I had been asked to show my passport—and arriving at my seat in the airplane, I dropped it, and whoever was behind me picked it up and pock eted it, in order to sell it. Internet research indicates that passports fetch a good price on the black market.`),
    paragraph(`At this point, an airport official came to escort me to the airport police station where my passport problem would be “sorted out.” He said that he had contacted the U.S. embassy, which was going to send someone to help me. When that person finally arrived at the police station, he informed me that I had picked a really bad time to lose my passport. The United States, under the direction of the recently elected president Donald Trump, had refused entry to any number of foreign citizens, creating lots of extra work for their diplomatic services. As a result, there was a very good chance that the French would use my case as part of a “payback” gesture. He explained that the police were going to question me, that I would be provided with a translator, and that I should be not just polite but very, very polite.`),
    paragraph(`The policeman who subsequently questioned me would have been intimidating, even if he hadn’t been wearing a gun on his hip. Through the translator, I told him my story and explained that I had been invited by the French minister of culture to attend an event at the Louvre. I even showed him the engraved invitation, which I imagined was the key that would unlock the door to Paris. He glanced at it and scoffed that it was “just a piece of paper.” He then asked me to sign seven different documents, all written in French. My French is pretty basic, so I asked the translator to translate them. She responded that it was just “the usual paperwork” and that I should sign. So sign I did, on the theory that a willingness to sign documents was an internationally recognized gesture of politeness.`),
    paragraph(`The policeman took the documents away to consult with a higher-up. About ten minutes later, he came back, with a scowl on his face. I expected the worst, but he announced that I had been granted permission to enter France but had to get a replacement passport as quickly as possible. My guess is that because of the Louvre invitation that “meant nothing,” his boss figured that to kick me out of the country would potentially be more trouble than letting me in—and so he did.`),
    paragraph(`My wife had not been allowed to come back with me during the questioning. I subsequently told her what had happened and showed her copies of the documents I had signed. Her French is much better than mine, and on scanning them, she commented that I had been wise to choose deportation by plane rather than by ship, should they have found it necessary to deport me. I was utterly unaware of having made this choice!`),
    paragraph(`I had arrived in Paris on a Saturday, so I had to wait till Monday to apply for a temporary passport at the U.S. embassy. On that day, my wife and I showed up there, only to discover that it was closed for American-celebrated President’s Day. A setback within a setback, I thought. How ingenious!`),
    paragraph(`We returned the next morning and took our place in line—it was twice as long as usual, a consequence of the embassy having been closed the day before. (This might be described as a setback caused by a setback within a setback; the Stoic gods were clearly working overtime on this one!) In this line were people who, like me, had passport problems. At that time, I was doing research for this book. It occurred to me that this was a wonderful opportunity to see how people handled setbacks, so while my wife held our place in line, I went around asking others how they came to be here.`),
    paragraph(`Everyone had a setback story to tell. Some had lost their passport or had it stolen, while others had stayed in France so long that their passport had expired. As I listened to people’s stories, I tried to assess how well they were doing in the aftermath of their setback. As was to be expected, many were angry and full of blame, but others seemed to have rebounded nicely.`),
    paragraph(`I got my replacement passport, and that afternoon we boarded the airplane for the trip back home. The Stoic test appeared to have concluded, so I graded my performance. Because I had spent the episode in a test-taker frame of mind, I had experienced very little frustration and no anger. My emotional state can best be described as a mixture of fascination—what would the Stoic gods do next?—and amusement at the test’s various twists and turns. I responded to many of them with—what else?—laughter.`),
    paragraph(`At that point it dawned on me that because I had made it my practice to respond to setbacks by using the Stoic test strategy, I had transformed myself from a person who regarded setbacks merely as an unfortunate aspect of life into someone who both studied and appreciated them. I had, in other words, become a setback connoisseur, and I concluded that the episode I had just experienced was the setback equivalent of the finest French champagne.`),
    paragraph(`I tipped my hat to the Stoic gods for their ingenuity in devising such a test. Having the pilot come back to talk to me was a nice touch, as was having the embassy closed on the day I needed it! I also thanked the gods for the gift of testing me in this manner. Not only was it an opportunity to show my Stoic stuff, but they had also handed me, on a silver platter, a setback story to tell—and a pretty good one, too, don’t you think?`)
