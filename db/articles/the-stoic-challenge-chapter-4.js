    paragraph(`In the preceding chapters, we explored what might be called the resilience continuum. At one end we find resilient individuals. When they encounter a setback, they bounce back quickly—or better still, they don’t get upset by the setback, meaning they have nothing to bounce back from. They come off looking strong and even heroic. At the other end of the continuum we find fragile individuals. On being set back, they become flustered, angry, or even despondent. As a result, they tend to be unhappy, and their friends and relatives may pity them rather than admire them.`),
    paragraph(`Why isn’t everyone resilient? The easy and popular answer: because not everyone can be. It is one of those things, like eye color, that we can’t control. It is to a large extent a consequence of how we happen to be “wired.” Some people are lucky enough to be born resilient; others are not.`),
    paragraph(`But this answer is mistaken. If people were “born resilient,” the way they are born with a certain eye color, we would expect resilience to be fairly constant from generation to generation, the way eye color is. If two parents have brown eyes, their children quite likely will. Recent history indicates, however, that this is not the case with resilience.`),
    paragraph(`Consider London during the Second World War. It was subjected to regular bombings. Before the war, experts had predicted that those who were bombed would experience extreme distress and that morale would be crushed. This is one reason Hitler thought it was worth doing. But just the opposite happened. People took to heart the advice to “Keep calm and carry on.” They followed in the footsteps of their British ancestors and kept, to the best of their ability, a stiff upper lip.`),
    paragraph(`In the last seventy years, though, things have changed. The great-grandchildren of these individuals are in many cases substantially less resilient than their ancestors were. And if this is true in Britain, it is arguably even truer in the United States. How can this be the case? What happened?`),
    paragraph(`Like any social change, this one is a complex phenomenon with lots of causal factors. One of them is arguably the 1969 publication of On Death and Dying. In this best-selling book, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross described the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally, acceptance. These were the stages, she said, that those diagnosed with a terminal illness typically go through—and the stages that these individuals should go through to effectively deal with grief.`),
    paragraph(`She later broadened her theory of grief recovery to include other setbacks, such as the death of a relative, the loss of a spouse through divorce, and even the loss of a job. The public took her recommendations to heart and concluded that it was risky to deal with setbacks on their own. This and other factors triggered a boom in psychological counseling, and by the end of the century, when a disaster struck, busloads of counselors would descend on ground zero to help its survivors.`),
    paragraph(`PSYCHOLOGISTS WEREN’T ALONE in undermining people’s resilience. Politicians also got into the act. Voters were not responsible, they said, for many of the setbacks they experienced. Those setbacks were instead inflicted on them by the unfair and imperfect society in which they lived. The politicians’ message: “Bad and stupid people have set you back. Vote for me, and I will make things right.”`),
    paragraph(`Politicians are, to be sure, correct in thinking that people can be the targets of injustice. They are also correct in thinking that many of the setbacks people experience are the result of that mistreatment. Politicians have an unfortunate habit, though, of thinking of these people and referring to them not as targets of injustice but as its victims. It is a label that many people are quick to accept. Being a victim, after all, relieves you of responsibility for many of the aspects of your life that have gone wrong. It also entitles you to special treatment: victims need time and space in which to recover and maybe even some kind of monetary compensation. At the same time, though, playing the role of victim is likely to increase the anguish you experience as the result of the wrongs that are done you. You will feel emotionally helpless.`),
    paragraph(`A resilient person will refuse to play the role of victim. To play this role is to invite pity, and she doesn’t regard herself as a pitiful being. She is strong and capable. She may not be able to control whether she is a target of injustice, but she has considerable control over how she responds to being targeted. She can let it ruin her day and possibly her life, or she can respond to it bravely, remaining upbeat while she looks for workarounds to the obstacles that people have wrongly placed in her path.`),
    paragraph(`This may sound naïve, but it describes the way many of the ancient Stoics responded to injustice. They tended to say and do things that got them into trouble with the powers that be. This was the case, as we have seen, with Paconius Agrippinus. It was also the case with other first-century philosophers, including Thrasea Paetus, Rubellius Plautus, Barea Soranus, and their Stoic teacher, Musonius Rufus. These individuals were remarkable for the courage they demonstrated in the face of the setbacks they experienced.`),
    paragraph(`Musonius Rufus was banished not once but twice, the second time to Gyaros, a desolate island in the Aegean Sea. He did not respond by becoming depressed or despondent, and he didn’t complain about his situation to those who visited him. In a lecture he subsequently gave, Musonius pointed out that exile does not deprive us of the things that matter most. An exiled person is not prevented from having courage, self-control, wisdom, or any other virtue.1 Furthermore, it is possible to profit from exile. It transformed Diogenes of Sinope, for example, from an ordinary person into one of the most fascinating philosophers of the fourth century BCE.2 Other people, whose bodies had been ruined by luxurious living, regained their health as the result of being banished.3`),
    paragraph(`Consider how different our world would be if Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi had played the role of victim. Suppose, more precisely, that they had been raised to think it was emotionally risky to deal with setbacks on their own and that at any rate, they shouldn’t have to deal with them. Under such circumstances, they probably wouldn’t have responded to the injustice they experienced as bravely as they did. They might instead have made an appointment with a therapist for advice on how best to cope with their situation, or they might have restricted their efforts to writing heartfelt letters to elected officials.`),

    paragraph(`BY THE END OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, many adults were willing to play the role of victim. At the same time, many children were being raised to believe that they should not and could not, on their own, rise to the challenges that life would likely present.`),
    paragraph(`On the advice of psychologists, parents of the 1990s and 2000s worked hard to give their children setback-free childhoods. They supervised their children’s play to prevent mishaps, and when accidents nevertheless happened, they cleaned up the resulting messes rather than expecting their children to do so. Likewise, when disputes arose among the children in their care, these parents assumed the role of referee instead of letting the children work things out for themselves.`),
    paragraph(`These overly protective parents also took steps to prevent their children from experiencing failure. The theory seems to have been that children who experienced lots of success would get used to succeeding and would therefore be more likely to succeed in the future. As a result, there were no longer winners and losers in competitive events; instead, everyone was a winner, so everyone got a trophy. In many schools, there were no longer failing grades; everyone who showed up for an exam got a passing grade, and everyone who stuck around for four years of high school graduated.`),
    paragraph(`When it came time for their children to apply for admission to college, their parents might have ghostwritten the “personal statement” required on their applications.4 These helicopter parents, as they came to be known, might have been thrilled to see how high their children’s grades were in the college courses they subsequently took. Whereas they might have worked hard for a gentleman’s C, their offspring were capable of getting As and Bs with minimal effort. Surely it was evidence that their parenting strategies had succeeded. Wasn’t it? 5`),
    paragraph(`Imagine the life of a person—let’s call him John—whose childhood has few setbacks, thanks in large part to the efforts of the adults in his life. Although this sheltered childhood will be pleasant, it deprives John of the chance to develop his setback-response skills, a downside that might not become apparent until he leaves home.`),
    paragraph(`When the adult John is set back, he might not rebound; he might instead experience a potent mix of hostility and despair. Likewise, instead of regarding the failures he experiences as stepping stones on the road to eventual success, he might regard them simply as traumatic events. John might also be quick to take offense at the things other people say and do, even though they are going out of their way to avoid offending him. His acquaintances might, for these reasons, characterize him (privately) as emotionally brittle. And one more comment is in order: even though John may be a passionate advocate of social justice, it is difficult to imagine him going on to become, say, the next Martin Luther King. Playing such a role would require self-confidence and inner strength, traits that John seems to lack.`),
    paragraph(`One can only imagine how John’s great-grandparents, if still alive, would react to his behavior. During World War II, they likely would have experienced many setbacks and might even have had to fight in the war. They nevertheless emerged from the ordeal as functional human beings who, if anything, were stronger and more appreciative of life than they formerly had been. And yet their great-grandson, despite living in peaceful and prosperous times, seems both unhappy and emotionally vulnerable.`),
    paragraph(`Some readers might have had a childhood like John’s and, as a result, might now lack resilience. If you are one of them, realize that my goal in comparing you to your great-grandparents is not to make you feel bad but to offer encouragement. If resilience were an innate trait, the way eye color is, you would likely have inherited it from your great-grandparents. The fact that you didn’t is therefore evidence that resilience is not an innate trait; it is instead an acquired ability—like the ability to ride a bike or to speak a foreign language. This in turn means that you have it in your power to become more resilient. It will require effort on your part to do so, but the resilience you gain can result in a dramatic improvement in the quality of whatever life you find yourself living. Let us therefore turn our attention, in Part II, to the Stoic advice on how to become more resilient.`)
