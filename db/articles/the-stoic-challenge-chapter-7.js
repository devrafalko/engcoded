    paragraph(`So much for anchoring. Framing is another curious psychological phenomenon that was employed by the ancient Stoics, only to be rediscovered and studied by modern psychologists. Whereas the use of anchoring can help us better appreciate our lives, the use of framing can prevent setbacks from disrupting our tranquility; indeed, frame events cleverly, and we might even find ourselves welcoming the setbacks we experience! This, I realize, is a pretty remarkable claim to make, so allow me to explain.`),
    paragraph(`I will begin by asking a hypothetical question. Suppose your physician informs you that you have a serious illness and offers you a choice between two medical procedures. One has a one-month survival rate of 90 percent, while the other has a 10 percent mortality rate in the first month. Which would you choose?`),
    paragraph(`Many people will be attracted to the first procedure because of its high survival rate. If you think about it more carefully, though, you will realize that a one-month survival rate of 90 percent is tantamount to a 10 percent mortality rate in the first month. A perfectly rational person would therefore find the two procedures equally attractive. People aren’t, however, perfectly rational. In particular, they are influenced by how choices are framed, and a choice framed in terms of survival will seem more attractive than the same choice framed in terms of death. Even highly trained physicians are susceptible to the framing phenomenon.1`),
    paragraph(`The Stoic philosophers long ago understood and appreciated the power of framing—not that they used this term to describe it. According to Epictetus, “Another person will not do you harm unless you wish it; you will be harmed at just that time at which you take yourself to be harmed.”2 More generally, he reminds us that “what upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about the things.”3 Seneca shared this view—“It is not how the wrong is done that matters, but how it is taken”4—as did Marcus Aurelius: “If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.”5 The Stoics, in other words, knew that while our subconscious mind is inclined to frame events in ways that trigger negative emotions, we can substantially undermine that tendency by consciously reframing events.`),
    paragraph(`We can, for example, think of our lives as an art gallery, in which the paintings are the events we experience daily. Although we have limited ability to control what paintings hang in this gallery, we have extensive control over how they are framed, and it turns out that framing makes all the difference. A painting that looks hideous in one frame might look sublime in another. In art gallery terms, then, an optimist is someone who customarily places life’s paintings into frames that make them look beautiful, and a pessimist is someone who places them into ugly frames.`),
    paragraph(`Stoics, as we have seen, are often caricatured as emotionless, wooden figures, but this simply isn’t the case. The Roman Stoics had a reputation for being not just optimistic but positively cheerful. They were vibrantly alive, and many appear to have been admired and even loved by those around them. One of the things that made them attractive was their penchant for seeing the bright side of things—for placing the paintings that life handed them into beautiful frames.`),
    paragraph(`images`),
    paragraph(`WHEN LIFE PRESENTS US WITH A SETBACK, we have many ways to explain it—many different frames, that is, in which to place it. As we have seen, our subconscious mind tends to assume that it was other people who set us back and that they did so on purpose and even with malice. I will refer to this as the blame frame. Once our subconscious mind has done this, our emotions will be aroused, and we will likely get angry. What could have been merely a setback transmogrifies into an ordeal.`),
    paragraph(`Fortunately, our conscious mind has the ability to undermine the operation of our subconscious mind. In particular, by coming up with alternative explanations for our setbacks, it puts them in frames that are neutral or even beautiful. It thereby prevents negative emotions from being triggered, and it can even give rise to positive emotions. Let us, therefore, explore some of the alternative frames that are available to the conscious mind.`),
    paragraph(`The competing obligations frame: Suppose someone refuses to give you something you hope to get. Your subconscious mind will likely provide a blame frame for this setback: the person in question is cheating you. As a result, you might find yourself getting angry. There are, however, other ways to explain your failure to get what you expected. The person deciding what you got may be enmeshed in a web of obligations, meaning that if she gives you what you want, she will be unable to give others what they deserve. If this is indeed the case, it would be wrong for you to get what you expected, and it would therefore be unreasonable for you to get angry for not getting it. By framing this setback as a consequence of competing obligations, you can avoid experiencing a number of negative emotions.`),
    paragraph(`The incompetence frame: Suppose a hotel clerk loses your reservation. Yes, he may have done so on purpose, but more likely he is simply incompetent. Frame the incident as incompetence rather than malice, and the emotion you subsequently experience might be pity rather than anger.`),
    paragraph(`The storytelling frame: When you have been set back, think in terms of the setback story you might tell in the future. It may be a story about how frustrated you were, how mean and stupid people are, and how unfair the world is. It can, in other words, be a truly boring story, the essence of which people have likely heard hundreds of times before. With a little effort on your part, though, you can “write,” with your behavior, a story that is not just interesting but potentially uplifting to those who hear it.`),
    paragraph(`Thinking in terms of future storytelling can take much of the sting out of the setbacks you experience. This is because your attention will be focused not on how you are being wronged but on what you must do to bring the story to a satisfying conclusion. And if events take a strange turn in the aftermath of a setback, you may, rather than getting even more upset, feel grateful. It puts, after all, an interesting wrinkle into your setback story.`),
    paragraph(`At this point, a clarification is in order. Using the storytelling frame does not mean that after muddling angrily through a setback, you make up a story about how wonderfully you handled it. The story you tell must be true. So for you to come off as resilient and competent in your story, you must actually be resilient and competent in your handling of the setback.`),
    paragraph(`Realize, too, that if a Roman Stoic like Epictetus employed the storytelling frame, he might not subsequently share the story he had “written” with other people. His primary goal in employing this frame, after all, would have been to avoid experiencing negative emotions in the aftermath of a setback, something he already would have accomplished by the time storytelling opportunities arose. Furthermore, if he did subsequently share the story, it would likely be for one of two reasons. The first would be to make people aware of a workaround for a setback they had experienced or might experience. The second would be to show a pessimistic person that experiencing a setback needn’t trigger negative emotions; indeed, it can even trigger positive emotions. How about that!`),
    paragraph(`Something Epictetus would not have done is share his setback stories with others in an attempt to impress them with his resilience and ingenuity. He knew full well that the values by which he and the other Roman Stoics lived were uncommon. Whereas most people valued fame and fortune,6 a Stoic’s primary goal in life was to attain and then maintain tranquility—to avoid, that is, experiencing negative emotions while continuing to enjoy positive emotions. He also knew that when people judge others, they do so in accordance with their own values, not in accordance with the values of the people they are judging. He therefore concluded that a sensible Stoic will ignore the praise of non-Stoics, so it would be pointless for him to go out of his way to gain that praise by sharing his setback stories.`),
    paragraph(`Epictetus even went so far as to suggest that we should take non-Stoics’ praise as a kind of reverse indicator of our progress as Stoics: “If people think you amount to something,” he said, “distrust yourself.”7 He might likewise take other people’s criticism of him as evidence that, as a practicing Stoic, he was on the right track. This sounds perverse, I know, but look at the unhappy people around you. The surest way to win their praise is to adopt and live in accordance with their values. It will then be easy for them to praise you, because by doing so, they are indirectly praising themselves. The snag, of course, is that by sharing their values you will likely end up sharing their misery.`),
    paragraph(`The comedic frame: When someone wrongs you, keep in mind Seneca’s comment that “laughter, and a lot of it, is the right response to the things which drive us to tears!”8 He also reminded us that this technique was employed by Socrates. After someone boxed his ears, Socrates responded not by getting angry but by commenting on how unfortunate it is, when we set out for a walk, that we can’t know ahead of time whether to wear a helmet.9`),
    paragraph(`I came across a wonderful example of the use of humor in the face of a setback while touring Machu Picchu in Peru. My guide said that a few years earlier, he had been leading a group of Australians on a four-day hike along the Inca Trail in the Andes Mountains. When the hike ended, the group returned to Aguas Calientes, a nearby town, where they would catch the train to Cusco, in order to board their flight back home. But then my guide found out the train wouldn’t be running for days—the Urubamba River was in flood stage, meaning that his clients were stuck in Aguas Calientes. When he informed them, they fell silent, until one of the Australians offered a brilliant response: “Well, then, let’s have some beer!” The rest of the group laughed, and off they went to a nearby bar.`),
    paragraph(`By responding to the setback with humor, the Australian not only prevented anger from arising in himself but set the tone for the group. His joke effectively cut off the sort of complaining that might otherwise have filled the vacuum. Once he played the beer card, it would have been very difficult for someone else to say, “I’ve got a better idea: let’s stand around and moan about how unfair life is.” Notice, too, that by going for beer, the Australians transformed a setback into a great story to share with friends in the future—a story about the time they got stuck in Aguas Calientes.`),
    paragraph(`Another time humor comes in handy is when we have been insulted.10 Lots of people respond to insults by getting angry, and the insult thereby sets them back. A better response is simply to laugh. By doing so, we not only forestall anger in ourselves but make the person who insulted us look like a fool: he hit us with his best verbal shot, and we just laughed it off.`),
    paragraph(`Laughter can also be an effective response to a profound personal calamity. Roger Ebert realized this. So did Michael Cubiss, a lively and fit former military officer who started an import business. At age forty, a massive cerebral hemorrhage left him “locked in,” not to the extent that Jean-Dominique Bauby was, but severely enough to limit his ability to engage in everyday activities. Cubiss responded to his predicament not by lapsing into depression but by using his well-developed sense of humor to make jokes about his ludicrous circumstances.11 Conclusion: if you can bring yourself to laugh at the things that make most people cry, you have a powerful weapon to use against life’s adversities.`),
    paragraph(`As we have seen, Socrates made a joke in response to a physical attack. Some might criticize this response on moral grounds: rather than simply laughing at his attacker, shouldn’t Socrates have turned him in to the police? 12 Doing this, after all, would decrease the chance that the attacker would attack Socrates or some other innocent person in the future.`),
    paragraph(`In response to this criticism, let me point out that using the comedic frame does not preclude us from turning in an attacker. By framing the attack, we can prevent it from harming us emotionally, and this is important to do, since the emotional harm we experience in the aftermath of an attack can far outweigh the physical harm. After that, we have the option of taking steps to prevent similar attacks on ourself and others in the future. Depending on the circumstances, this might mean turning in the attacker to the authorities. I should add that the historical record does not indicate whether this is what Socrates did.`),
    paragraph(`The game frame: Consider the following scenario: while you are running, someone comes up from behind and tackles you to the ground. How would you react? Given only this much information, you might instinctively place the event in a blame frame: you have been wronged and will be quite angry at the brute responsible for the attack.`),
    paragraph(`But before we go any further, let me add one more element to the above scenario: at the time you were tackled from behind, you were playing rugby, and the tackle was legal under rugby rules. Under such circumstances, it would be absurd for you to point an accusing finger and place the event in a blame frame. You should instead place it in what might be called a game frame. Getting tackled is, after all, part of the game of rugby, and if you didn’t want to get tackled, you should have stayed off the field of play.`),
    paragraph(`Although getting tackled might count as a setback in the context of a rugby game, it is a setback you must shrug off if you are to play rugby effectively. Furthermore, rather than treating the tackler like a criminal, you should treat him, as long as he didn’t break any rules, as a worthy competitor on the field of play. By employing the game frame, we can take much of the sting out of events that would otherwise be traumatic. It is therefore surprising that we don’t employ this frame more often.`),
    paragraph(`The author Jean Liedloff tells a story that nicely illustrates the power of game framing. As a young woman, she was invited by two Italian men to go diamond hunting in Venezuela. It sounded like a wonderful adventure, so she accepted the invitation. They hired several South American Indians as laborers and obtained a heavy and cumbersome dugout canoe in which to travel.`),
    paragraph(`At one point in the journey, they had to carry the canoe over jagged rocks in the tropical sun, with Liedloff doing her share of the carrying. All of them got cut, bruised, and seared by the sun-heated rocks. In the course of the portage, though, she noticed that whereas the Italians were treating each cut and bump as another setback and cursing in response, the Indians were treating the experience as a game. The canoe’s unpredictable movements made them laugh. Getting pinned against hot rocks by the canoe was for them not grounds for complaint but an excuse for more laughter. Her account of the episode:`),
    paragraph(`All were doing the same work; all were experiencing strain and pain. There was no difference in our situations except that we had been conditioned by our culture to believe that such a combination of circumstances constituted an unquestionable low on the scale of well-being and were quite unaware that we had any option in the matter. The Indians, on the other hand, equally unconscious of making a choice, were in a particularly merry state of mind, reveling in the camaraderie; and, of course, they had had no long build-up of dread to mar the preceding days. Each forward move was for them a little victory.13`),
    paragraph(`She decided to join the Indians in framing the endeavor as a game and found that it made the rest of the trip much easier. By framing a setback as a component of a game, we can dramatically reduce its emotional impact. And the game in question needn’t be a formal game like rugby; it can be an impromptu game, like the Indians’ canoe game.`),
    paragraph(`The Stoic test frame: The last frame that we shall consider has gamelike elements: when confronted by a setback, the Stoics say, we should pretend that imaginary Stoic gods are testing us with our well-being in mind. To pass this test—and thereby win the game—we must stay calm while finding a workaround for the setback. It is a fanciful frame, to be sure, but a useful one nonetheless.`),
    paragraph(`The ancient Stoics knew that although we have limited control over what setbacks we experience, we have considerable discretion in how we frame them and hence considerable control over how they affect us. People normally think of setbacks as annoying events, or even worse, as undeserved tribulations; as a result, they respond by getting frustrated or angry. By choosing another frame, we can keep our cool in the face of a setback and thereby increase our chances of finding the optimal workaround. And not only that, but by employing the Stoic test frame, we can interpret setbacks as interesting challenges, thereby deriving a degree of satisfaction from dealing with them. This sounds amazing, I know, but it’s true, so let us take a closer look at the Stoic test strategy.`)
