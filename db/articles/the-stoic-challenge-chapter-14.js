    paragraph(`Sometimes life goes smoothly: the setbacks we encounter are few and easily overcome. This, we might tell ourselves, is how things should always be. Once we start thinking in terms of Stoic tests, though, we will respond to such periods with mixed emotions. We might grumble that they deprive us of chances to “show our Stoic stuff”—a concern we can deal with by undertaking Stoic adventures. Such a period might also make us nervous: we will worry that the Stoic gods are setting us up—that they have arranged this setback-free period to set the stage for a particularly devious Stoic test. Allow me to explain.`),
    paragraph(`I’ve mentioned that I’m a rower—not a very good one, but a committed rower nonetheless. I compete at the masters level, but this statement is potentially misleading. To compete as a masters rower, a person needn’t demonstrate a mastery of rowing; he need only be old. To level the playing field, masters rowers are assigned an age-dependent time handicap. As I write this, my handicap is thirty-eight seconds. This means a “young” person—someone who is, say, twenty-eight—will have to do a 1,000-meter race in thirty-eight fewer seconds than I do in order for us to tie, in age-adjusted terms. Next year, my handicap will be up to forty seconds. I can hardly wait.`),
    paragraph(`Because of handicapping, the person who crosses the finish line first in a masters race won’t necessarily win. Rowers’ handicaps have to be subtracted from their elapsed time in order to come up with their age-adjusted time, and the rower with the best age-adjusted time will be declared the winner. It is therefore possible for a very old rower, although the last to cross the finish line, to be declared the winner. Likewise, the person who crosses the finish line first, if he is young, might come in last place, in age-adjusted terms.`),
    paragraph(`A few years ago I rowed in a 1,000-meter race against a competitive field. I rowed well: I followed my race plan and didn’t make any big mistakes. I successfully fended off Lazy Bill, who put in a dramatic appearance 700 meters into the race, with repeated entreaties to “slow down, for God’s sake!” After completing the race, I docked my boat and carried it back to the trailer. A few minutes later the results of the race were announced over the venue’s PA system. I had won! I went off to collect my gold medal, and on being handed it, I felt the rush of success. It was wonderful.`),
    paragraph(`I came back to my team’s trailer proudly wearing the medal and eager to show it to my teammates. I described my race-winning strategy to anyone who would listen—how I’d strug gled during the last 300 meters, and how I’d thought my heart would explode during the last five strokes. I told them that yes, it would be okay if they took my picture wearing the medal. And then the PA system crackled back to life. It informed us that there had been a mistake in the previous announcement. The names of the top three finishers were read, and mine was not among them.`),
    paragraph(`I went to the scoring tent to find out what was going on. It turned out that race officials had accidentally given me an extra minute of age handicap, and once that was removed, I had fallen from first place to last. Groan! I was stunned, but then it dawned on me that I had been the target of a setup.`),
    paragraph(`In the setbacks we have examined in this book, the Stoic gods place an unexpected obstruction in our path; in a setup, they are extraordinarily nice to us, but only in order to set the stage for a subsequent setback. In this case, they created in me the perception that I had won a race that I had in fact lost. By doing so, they made the setback I subsequently experienced that much worse. It involved an element of (self-inflicted) public humiliation. It also revealed a streak of Stoic hypocrisy in me: after all my talk about how I race as a form of Stoic training, here I was, boasting about my victory. Blush!`),
    paragraph(`I did my best to regain my equanimity. After returning the medal, I congratulated the Stoic gods for their ingenuity and went back to my team’s trailer. I explained the timing error to my teammates and lightened things with a touch of self-deprecating humor. “The next time I win a race,” I told them, “I’m not going off to collect the medal. I’m going to the timing tent to demand a recount!”`),
    paragraph(`THE ANCIENT GREEKS were well aware of the setup phenomenon. They believed that the goddess Nemesis liked to punish extreme pride and foolish overconfidence, otherwise known as hubris. What particularly irked her were people who not only expected things to go well for them in the future but also were convinced that they somehow deserved for them to go well. When she discovered such individuals, she would waste no time bringing them back to reality. How dare they think they were immune to setbacks! They were, after all, mere mortals. Nemesis was both powerful and remorseless, and it was impossible to hide from her. She also had a talent for arranging setups that, besides being brutal, were ironic.`),
    paragraph(`Nemesis is most famous for her punishment of Narcissus, a youth who, because of his good looks, had many admirers, all of whom he spurned. Narcissus can best be described as—you guessed it—narcissistic. He was quite in love with himself. Nemesis consequently went into action. She lured him to a pool in which he could see his own reflection. On seeing it, he found his beauty so compelling that he could not tear himself away and as a result starved to death.`),
    paragraph(`On another occasion, it dawned on the tyrannical king Polycrates that his life was going exceedingly well. He started worrying that Nemesis would take notice and punish him for his good fortune. To assuage her, he made numerous offerings, but his string of good luck continued. Desperate, Polycrates sailed out into the ocean and threw his most valuable ring into the water as an offering to Nemesis.`),

Desperate, Polycrates sailed out into the ocean and threw his most valuable ring into the water as an offering to Nemesis.`),
    paragraph(`Convinced that this would do the job, he sailed back home and decreed that a giant feast be held. His cook ordered that hundreds of fish be caught so they could be served at the feast. The cook cleaned the fish, but when he opened the belly of the largest one, he found the ring Polycrates had thrown into the sea. It was a sure sign, Polycrates thought, that Nemesis had rejected his offering. He became so anxious that he couldn’t eat, and like Narcissus, he perished.`),
    paragraph(`The Roman Stoics were well aware of the danger presented by a period that was free of setbacks. Seneca warned that “Although all things in excess bring harm, the greatest danger comes from excessive good fortune: it stirs the brain, invites the mind to entertain idle fancies, and shrouds in thick fog the distinction between falsehood and truth.”1 When such a period ends, as it someday surely will, the setback that ends it will seem much worse than it otherwise would.`),
    paragraph(`AS WE HAVE SEEN, the ancient Stoics weren’t opposed to the experience of positive emotions, such as delight and even joy. They cautioned, though, against allowing ourselves to become overjoyed, since doing so increases our chances of being miserable when we are ultimately set back. We should instead take good fortune in stride, the way, ideally, we take bad fortune. Do things right, and other people will be unaware of our fortune, whether it be good or bad. Obviously, I did not follow this advice on “winning” the above-described race. Shame on me. And have I learned my lesson? I hope so, but only time will tell.`),
    paragraph(`Some will reject the advice that we keep our good news to ourselves. They are convinced that we should share our successes with friends and relatives, and that doing so brings our joy into their lives. This can happen, but it is also possible for people to respond in a negative manner to our good news. Suppose, in particular, that as the result of our successes, we start getting cocky, as if this is simply the way things are supposed to be. On detecting such an attitude, friends and relatives are likely to start rooting against us, albeit secretly. They don’t think that we are better, harder working, or more deserving than they are; we are just lucky, and here we are, flaunting our luck before them.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose that even though we don’t publicize our successes, other people become aware of them. Our socially safest response, under these circumstances, is to attribute our success to luck. It is probably what people already think, so we won’t get an argument from them. It also makes them less likely to become unwitting accomplices in the Stoic gods’ eventual attempt to take us down a notch.`),
    paragraph(`In Chapter 6 we encountered Daniel Kahneman, who together with Amos Tversky did pioneering research on anchoring and framing. In 2011 Kahneman wrote a general audience book describing their research, Thinking, Fast and Slow. He worried that doing this would damage his professional reputation—professors aren’t supposed to write books (like the one you are now reading) that “normal people” can understand and profit from. But he went ahead and published it anyway. Thinking, Fast and Slow soon made the New York Times best-seller list.`),
    paragraph(`Astonished, Kahneman sheepishly explained to his colleagues that the book’s appearance there was a mistake. When it stubbornly remained on the list, Kahneman modified his story: he told people that it was staying on the list only so that the Times wouldn’t have to admit to having made a mistake in putting it there in the first place.2 It was a clever envy avoidance maneuver on his part.`)
