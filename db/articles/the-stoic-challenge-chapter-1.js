    paragraph(`Sometimes your life is going along smoothly—splendidly, even—and then out of the blue, an obstacle appears. It can happen at work, at play, at home, or as was the case with my airport setback, while traveling. The plan you devised for yourself can no longer be carried out, so you have to come up with a new one.`),
    paragraph(`In a typical day, you likely experience any number of setbacks. You might stub your toe or burn the toast you are making for breakfast. You might get caught in the rain without an umbrella or find yourself stuck in a traffic jam that makes you late for work. But these are low-grade setbacks, mere nuisances, hiccups in your daily routine. Getting the flu is a more significant setback, especially if it disrupts your plans for the next few days. Unexpectedly losing your job almost certainly counts as a major setback, inasmuch as it will force you to change many of your plans for the coming months. These setbacks are easily topped, though, by the death of a spouse, by discovering that you have a fatal illness, or by being imprisoned for a crime you didn’t commit—or for one you did.`),
    paragraph(`You might assume that your death would count as a major setback, but whether it does depends on what happens after you die. Suppose there is no life after death. Then your death might count as a setback for your survivors but not for you. After all, in the absence of an afterlife, dying requires no change of plans on your part; it instead means the end of planning, period.`),
    paragraph(`If there is an afterlife, though, death might count as a setback. If reincarnation is true, you might come back as a person, in which case your death means another lifetime of dealing with setbacks, which itself might be construed as a major setback. And if you come back not as a person but as, say, a mosquito, you will face a whole new set of challenges—although you probably won’t have sufficient brainpower to think of them as setbacks.`),
    paragraph(`Suppose, however, that life after death involves not reincarnation into another body but continued existence as yourself. If you spend your afterlife in hell, then your death would represent the biggest setback imaginable. If you spend it in heaven, your death would represent not a setback but a major advance—a setforward, as it were—since it would involve a transition to an infinitely preferable existence.`),
    paragraph(`It isn’t clear, though, that you would be eternally happy in heaven. The problem is that when you went there, you would take your personality with you—including, quite likely, a propensity to take whatever you have for granted. Before long, you would start taking heaven’s perfection for granted, and it would therefore cease to delight you. Perhaps God, in his infinite wisdom, will cause you to experience minor setbacks in heaven, just to prevent you from getting spoiled.`),
    paragraph(`Along similar lines, Satan—if he exists—probably realizes that a hell in which setbacks are possible is more hellish than one in which they aren’t. He will therefore take steps to prevent the damned from thinking their situation is hopeless. In particular, he might periodically allow them to experience a ray of hope, just so he can subsequently deal them a setback by cruelly extinguishing it.`),
    paragraph(`SOMETIMES IT IS NATURE that sets you back. A deer might run into the path of your car, causing you to total it. Or a storm might leave you without electrical power for a week. During that time, you will discover the extent to which you take the presence of electricity for granted, and after power is restored, you will likely, if you are paying attention, discover how little time it takes you to start taking it for granted again.`),
    paragraph(`In most cases, though, it isn’t nature that obstructs your progress; it is other people. Often they do so without intending to harm you. An incompetent waiter, for example, might get your order mixed up. Or a driver might swerve to miss a deer, thereby avoiding a setback for himself but causing you to swerve and subsequently crash your car, thereby setting you back financially and maybe medically as well.`),
    paragraph(`In other cases, someone sets you back on purpose. In order to punish his teenage daughter for getting bad grades, a father might take away her driving privileges for a month. To her, this might seem like one of the worst setbacks imaginable. Likewise, someone might set you back by picking your pocket. It is possible that he picked it because his money was stolen during a drug deal, in which case what to you counts as a setback will for him count as the workaround for a setback. Cases like this, by the way, show that setbacks can be contagious, much as diseases are. And finally, sheer malice might cause someone to set another person back: when you were a child, you might have deprived a sibling of a favorite toy, just to have the pleasure of watching him cry.`),
    paragraph(`When you are angry that someone has set you back, it is helpful to recall that although other people are responsible for many of the setbacks you experience, you are likewise responsible for many of theirs. Yes, you find them annoying, but maybe, just maybe, they find you annoying as well. In particular, they may be annoyed by how easily annoyed you are. This fact is easy to forget, given that you are more acutely aware of the problems others cause you than you are of the problems you cause them. One sign of maturity is a realization of the extent to which you, either intentionally or unintentionally, make life difficult for those around you. Consequently, you should keep in mind the words of Seneca: “we are bad men living among bad men; and only one thing can calm us—we must agree to go easy on one another.”`),
    paragraph(`Another thing to keep in mind about the setbacks you experience is that if you drew up a list of the people who have caused you setbacks, you would have to put yourself on that list, probably at the top. Many of the setbacks you experience are the result of poor planning on your part. You ran out of gas because you failed to check your car’s fuel gauge before setting out on a trip. Or maybe you overslept on the last day of your vacation and missed your flight home because you failed to set your alarm. In other cases, you might be set back because of poor choices you made. You might, for example, develop a case of shingles because you refused to get vaccinated.`),
    paragraph(`SETBACKS AND DESIRES ARE INTERCONNECTED: whether something counts as a setback depends on what a person wants, and how significant the setback is depends on how much he wants it. For many people, catching a cold is merely an annoyance, but for a marathoner who has trained for years to compete in the Olympics, catching a cold the day before the race will count as a major setback. Along similar lines, if you lose your two front teeth when you are a six-year-old, you will likely regard it not as a setback but as a rite of passage, as well as an opportunity to get a reward from the Tooth Fairy. Lose your front teeth the morning of your wedding, though, and you will almost certainly regard it as a disaster.`),
    paragraph(`Because of the connection between setbacks and desires, if a person were incapable of experiencing desire, nothing would count as a setback. Conversely, to a person who has to have everything just so, setbacks will be routine occurrences in what is probably a very unhappy existence. Furthermore, a person with unusual desires will be subject to unusual setbacks. Most drowning people would be grateful if a good Samaritan pulled them from the water, but for someone trying to commit suicide, it would count as a setback.`),
    paragraph(`How many setbacks you experience depends, as I have suggested, on how much foresight you possess. The days of a thoughtless person are likely to be filled with obstacles that he failed to anticipate, and as a result, he is likely to find life both frustrating and unfair. Were he not so thoughtless, he would fathom the reason for his misfortune.`),
    paragraph(`Thoughtful people, by contrast, minimize the number of setbacks they experience by learning how the world works and using this knowledge to plan their activities. No matter how carefully they plan for the future, though, life will occasionally deal them a setback: the computer of their fully fueled and recently serviced hybrid vehicle might develop a glitch, thereby bringing it to a halt during rush hour on the freeway.`),
    paragraph(`If you are reading these words, you are doubtless a thoughtful individual who spends time and energy thinking ahead in order to prevent foreseeable setbacks. But have you also spent time and energy developing a strategy for minimizing the emotional harm done to you by unforeseeable setbacks? You should have, since when you add up the costs imposed on you by being set back, you will often find that the biggest cost by far is the emotional distress a setback triggers.`),
    paragraph(`You can gain important insight into setbacks by monitoring the impact they have on your life. Try keeping a setback journal in which you record the setbacks you experience, their source, their significance, and your response to them. Doing this will make you aware of the extent to which setbacks carry a double cost. The first might be described as their physical cost. If your car breaks down on the freeway, there are lots of things you will physically have to do, including spend money, to deal with this setback. Likewise, if your doctor tells you that you have cancer, the therapy you undergo will have physical costs in terms of sickness and discomfort.`),
    paragraph(`But alongside these physical costs, there will be emotional costs. You might become very angry as the result of the car breakdown, and you might become profoundly sad as the result of the cancer diagnosis. Not only that, but in many cases, the emotional cost of a setback is far greater than the physical cost. Wouldn’t it be great if you could reduce the emotional cost of a setback or even eliminate it entirely? It turns out that you can, by using the Stoic test strategy.`),
    paragraph(`WE CAN LEARN A LOT from studying other people’s responses to setbacks. Such study is facilitated by people’s willingness to share their setback stories. Sometimes the simple act of greeting someone—“How are things going?”—will trigger one. Likewise, your comment to a friend that your water heater sprang a leak might elicit a reciprocal setback tale: “So did mine, last year.”`),
    paragraph(`People are also inclined to top whatever setback tales we share with them. When we tell them that we got sick after eating at a restaurant, they might respond by telling us, in considerable detail, about the time they were sick for three days after eating at a taco stand in Tijuana, Mexico. There are also people who don’t just mention setbacks they have experienced but talk about them almost exclusively, and in the process they rejuvenate the anger triggered in them by those setbacks. Such individuals, needless to say, are not the most agreeable of companions. Nevertheless, when you encounter them, you should pay close attention. Do you sometimes respond to setbacks the way they do? And if so, is there a way for you to overcome this tendency? If you can, your days will go much smoother, and you might, as a result, find that you are enjoying your life as never before.`),
    paragraph(`Sometimes we share our setback stories as a kind of public service. We hope that by telling others about a setback, we can warn them of an obstacle that they, too, might encounter. And by telling people how we responded to that setback, we can help them deal with it if, despite our warning, they fall victim to it. In other cases, people who tell us about a setback want our help: consider the stranger who tells us her purse was snatched, leaving her without any cash, credit cards, or ID. In yet other cases, someone will tell us a setback story in the hope that we will join them in their fight against the social injustice that gave rise to that setback.`),
    paragraph(`People also tell setback stories in an attempt to impress us with their resilience in the face of setbacks and their ingenuity in finding workarounds for them. Others have the opposite motivation for telling setback stories: they seek not our admiration but our pity. They might, in particular, want us to reassure them that it isn’t their fault that they experienced the setback they did—an unfair world is instead to blame.`),
    paragraph(`WATCHING PEOPLE BEING SET BACK can be deliciously rewarding—if, at any rate, we think they deserve to be set back. Suppose, for example, that your abusive boss is summarily fired by his boss. Justice at last! Watching people overcome setbacks can also be entertaining. This is one of the reasons people have an interest in spectator sports. We love to see the team we are rooting for impose setbacks on opposing teams. In baseball, batters are struck out, players are injured, and games are lost. We also love watching our favored team recover, in heroic fashion, from a setback it experienced. Remove the setbacks from sports, and they would become as boring as watching someone mow a lawn.`),
    paragraph(`When we aren’t watching sports, we might spend our time reading a novel. Our interest in literature can also be explained, in part, by our fascination with setbacks. Novels are full of them, and with good reason. A novel in which two characters fall in love on their first meeting, get married, never fight, and live happily ever after would be a commercial failure. Authors realize this and therefore go out of their way to confront characters with obstacles. As a result, their characters’ relationships don’t run smoothly: hearts get broken. Their lives are also filled with drama: they might contract an illness or be the victim of a crime. The same rule applies to cinema.`),
    paragraph(`Most people don’t attempt to write short stories, novels, or screenplays, thinking it would require a degree of creativity that they lack. Ask them to describe a recent setback, though, and you might trigger their creative juices. They might add elements and characters to their setback tale in an attempt to make the setback sound less foreseeable and more challenging than it was. By doing this, they make their solution to the setback seem all the more amazing—or if they failed to find a solution, they make the failure more understandable.`),
    paragraph(`Another time our creative juices flow is when we are asleep. We dream about strange things, some good and some bad, and one thing that makes bad dreams bad is the setbacks we experience in them. We might be unable to find things we need, be prevented from seeing people we need to see, or be unable to do things we need to do, such as shout out a word of warning to a loved one who is in imminent danger. A single dream might contain a chain of setbacks: just when we think we have found a solution to one, another setback prevents us from implementing that solution. Drat! When our dreaming selves finally conclude that a setback is insurmountable—suppose the dragon that has been blocking our path through the woods has laid its reptilian claws on us—we often respond by waking up. And on doing so, we will likely feel compelled to share our dream-world setbacks with friends and relatives.`),
    paragraph(`The setbacks we experience while awake cannot likewise be eliminated simply by opening our eyes. It is therefore important that we develop an effective strategy for dealing with them. Unfortunately, the strategy that many people employ isn’t just ineffective, it’s counterproductive. It results in them becoming first frustrated and then angry, which substantially increases the harm done them by the setback.`)
